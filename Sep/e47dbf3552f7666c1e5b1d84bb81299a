Durban - It was a sad day at Meropa’s Wildthingz Bird and Reptile Park in Polokwane when Adam the Burmese Python passed on. Over the past 17 years,  Adam was said to be the focus of attention of thousands of children on school tours and other visitors who have revelled at the opportunity to touch him and have their photos taken with him. According to spokesperson for Meropa, Azelle Evans, Adam got sick about a month ago and on the advice from his vet, his handlers took the decision to stop his interactions with guests and allow him to rest. "He was put on treatment and received the best possible care. During this time, schools and other caring citizens have called Meropa to enquire when Adam would be part of the popular snake shows again. However, his time had come and Adam took his final breath on 28 August 2018. Meropa’s management and staff, and especially Adam’s handlers, are saddened by the loss of Adam." Peter Guthrie, General Manager at Meropa, added: “It is indeed a sad loss for us and for all of the visitors who had the chance to interact with him over the years. We would like to thank the schools and members of the public that have shown interest and concern about Adam.” POST
