Durban - In celebration of Arbor Month, Sibaya Casino donated 30 indigenous trees donated to a primary school in Ottawa. Volunteers from Sibaya rolled up their sleeves at Jhugroo Primary School in Ottawa to plant the trees at the school. The plants were a variety of ground cover, shrubs and shades trees that are indigenous to KwaZulu-Natal. Printing of pictures and information about protected trees that are becoming extinct will be sponsored and placed in the school library to raise awareness amongst the learners. Arbor Month, observed annually every September, aims to create awareness of the effects of deforestation and urbanization on the environment, as well as to encourage South Africans to do their bit to help replenish what has been lost by planting more trees. Solomon Khumalo the Safety, Health and Environment Manager who coordinated the initiative said planting trees should be a collective effort. “As with so many things, one person planting one tree will make little difference.  However, if we all band together and plant trees in Arbor Month, the cumulative effect is meaningful. So, let’s plant and grow together." POST
