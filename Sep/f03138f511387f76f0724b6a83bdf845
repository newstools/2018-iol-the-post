The 27-year-old, of Verulam, said she owed her academic achievement to her parents, Ronnie and Cookie. “Financially, it was difficult for my parents. While they are employed, the university fees are exorbitant and can range from anything between R24000 to R30000 each year,” she said. “Their sacrifices and support over the past seven years has brought me to where I am today. A day before my graduation ceremony, we had just paid off the remaining fees.” Marimuthu, a process engineer at Deloitte Consulting, is planning to do her PhD and MBA as well as PrEng (professional engineering qualification). “I would also love to manage my own consulting practice but my most important goal, is to send my parents on a holiday and build a secure comfortable life for them.” She added her determination to succeed and provide a better life for her family had pulled her through her academic journey - as there were days she never thought she would graduate. “My first year of university was shattering. I got supplementary exams for 80% of my modules. I rewrote and had to repeat them the following year. It was at this time that my career choice was questioned. “However, I knew chemical engineering was my passion and so I cried a little, but picked myself up and continued to study. “Last year, during my final year, I had just gone through the challenging experience of final-year design, only to log on to Student Central and find that I passed all but one module. It was at this time that I felt like throwing in the towel but I realised that giving up was not an option and so I pressed on. “There will be good days and there will be really bad days as well and that’s okay. “You need to learn to push on and understand that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel,” she said “No matter where life takes you, you need to remain strong-minded and focused.” POST
