Durban - Staff members at University of KwaZulu Natal are entitled to pet bereavement leave. Staff will be allowed to take one day per annum to mourn the death of a registered family companion pet, the university said in a statement this week. "The rationale was that for many staff, their pets were akin to close family members," said the acting executive director of corporate relations at UKZN Normah Zondo. "The idea of giving staff a day off to take care of their pets in the event of bereavement resonated with the leadership of the University. "This was one of many staff benefits that were factored into the new Conditions of Service to ensure that we remain the employer of choice," added Zondo. Staff member Ishana Gangaram lost her dog Margo in April. Gangaram said Margo had congenital defect from birth, and that she knew she wasn’t going to make it but took her in. The puppy was 20 months when she passed on. For librarian Ashika Pramlal her dog was her child. According to UKZN Pramlal had no kids and her dog Coco, 14,  a cross between a golden retriever and german shepard was like her child. He died in July. DAILY NEWS
