Durban - The domestic worker who was acquitted of the murder of Musgrave widow Shakila Singh, but found guilty of robbery with aggravating circumstances, will hear her fate on Friday in the Durban High Court. Nonjabulo Mteki along with her two co-accused, Amon Ngongi and Ally Jumah Abdullah will be sentenced today. Ngongi, 30, and Abdullah, 41, apparent refugees from Tanzania, were convicted of murder after the 55-year-old mother of two was found dead on her bedroom floor with duct tape around her face, her hands and legs bound by plastic cable ties. It is believed that Mteki planned a house robbery with her then boyfriend, who hired two men to carry out the crime. Singh was murdered during the robbery. During mitigation of sentence, Mtekiâ€™s attorney, Nhlanhla Mnculwane revealed that Mteki had been working for 14 years and had become a member of the family. Mnculwane said weapons were not part of the plan and her co-accused were meant to take the valuables and leave. Mnculwane appealed for a lesser sentence as Mteki had already spent two years in prison. Abdullah and Ngongi's legal representatives both put forward that the accused were family men and were breadwinners of their families. Abdullah and Ngongi each ran a hair salon. State prosecutor, Vasi Chetty later argued that Mteki was integrated into Singh's family and took advantage of what was provided for her. "She was motivated by greed and nothing else. She had no degree of compassion even though Sing paid for her child's school fees." Chetty accused Mteki of shifting the blame on others, revealing her "callous nature". Chetty added that Abdullah and Ngongi were accepted as refugees into the country and the manner in which they behaved leaves a distaste behind. He also asked the court to take into account the trauma of Singh's children, who had to leave the country to escape from what was happening. POST
