Durban - A split second decision by an off-duty policeman during an armed robbery at a KwaZulu-Natal shopping centre yesterday, led to the arrests of four men who had just robbed a shop minutes earlier. Captain Velasazi Ndlela from Empangeni SAPS was with his family inside the centre, when he realised what was happening at one of the shops. Police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, explained that four men entered a shop and one of the men approached the cashier. “At gunpoint the suspect instructed the cashier to remove cash from the till and place it in his bag,” Gwala said. She said the remaining three men threatened the security guard and tried to open a cell phone display case but were not successful in their feat. “Captain Ndlela managed to sneak out and waited for the men at entrance to the mall, with his service pistol in hand. One of the suspects realised that Ndlela was waiting for them and fired shots at him, while summoning for the rest of the gang to flee,” she said. Gwala said as they attempted to flee a shootout ensued and two gang members were injured. “The remaining two continued with their attempted to flee but they were promptly arrested a few meters away from the scene, by police officers who responded to their colleagues call for backup. Two unlicensed firearms and a bag containing an undisclosed amount of cash was seized,” she said. The injured men were taken to hospital under police guard. Gwala said the four, aged between 21 and 34 will appear in the Empangeni Magistrate’s Court next week. They face charges of attempted murder, robbery and possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. Daily News
