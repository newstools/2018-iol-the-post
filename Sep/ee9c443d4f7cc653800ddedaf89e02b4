Durban - A R165 million trauma unit has been opened at the CJ Crookes Hospital in Scottburgh on the South Coast. The state of the art building was officially opened on Tuesday morning by South Coast residents KZN Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo. According to the Department of Health the facility which consists of both a Casualty Unit and Trauma facilities boasts world-class equipment. MEC Dhlomo said the sophistication of this trauma unit was comparable to those in the private sector. He says it is also strategically located to come to the aid of people with emergency situations. “GJ Crookes Hospital is located alongside N2, one of the busiest parts of the N2 highway, which also has many accidents. "Between Port Shepstone (70km away) and Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospitals (50km away), you need a facility like this one, to take care of patients that would otherwise have died if you were to transfer them. "In 24 hours, it sees an average of 30 trauma or poly trauma (multiple injuries) per day, who can be ventilated, resuscitated and be kept here until they are stable. Some are even discharged from here or transferred.” MEC Dhlomo also appealed to healthcare professionals to go beyond just working at a state of the art facility, and ensure patients are treated with respect, care and dignity.
