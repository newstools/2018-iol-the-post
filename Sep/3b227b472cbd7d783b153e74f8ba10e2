Durban - To commemorate 70 years since the tension between Africans and Indians broke out, the eThekwini Municipality will host a social cohesion seminar to discuss African-Indian relations at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre on September 27. The seminar will be hosted by the city’s Parks, Recreation and Culture unit, as part of Heritage month. The 10-day initiative will showcase its services and products through various programmes. More than 140 lives were lost when bitter racial conflict between Indians and Africans occurred in Durban, in 1949. More than 1 000 people were injured, with buildings and dwellings also destroyed and damaged and shops were looted, according to SA History Online. The city said that against the backdrop of recent incidents between Indian and Africans, there is a need to have an open conversation about the issue. The planned seminar is aimed at creating a platform for both parties to have a mediated conversation. Parks and recreation head Thembinkosi Ngcobo will officially launch the programme at the Beachwood Mangrove Nature Reserve on Wednesday. Ngcobo will take audiences on an exciting schedule of events followed by a voluntary beach cleaning exercise. To culminate the programme on September 29, a performing arts showcase of dance, music, and fun for kids will take place at New Beach. Media personality Alex Mthiyane will host the seminar, A Seminar on Indians and Africans. Some of the key topics include Are Africans Racist? Are Indians Racist?
