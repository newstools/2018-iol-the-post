DURBAN - THE Constitutional Court ruling on the private home use dagga has come at the right time as it's the prime season to grow cannabis. This was the view of Cannabis activist, Krithi Thaver, who was "ecstatic" that the private use of marijuana had been decriminalized. On Tuesday, the ConCourt ruled that the personal use of cannabis would no longer be a criminal offence, nor would it be illegal to cultivate the plant for one's own use. Thaver, who is the founder of Canna Culture South Africa - an organisation which creates awareness about cannabis use for medical and economic benefits, and is also the chairperson of the Cannabis Developing Council of South Africa. He also owns Africa's first cannabis dispensary, located in Durban North - the Holistic Relief Wellness and Pain Management Centre. "This decision couldn't have come at a better time, this is the prime season for planting cannabis," he said. Thaver, an expert on the plant, gave three important tips for growing dagga at home; 1. Cannabis needs maximum sunlight, so grow you plant in an area that will get plenty of sunlight. 2. Feed your plant regularly by providing fresh water. "Take care of your plant the way you would take care of a child - feed it regularly. The quality of your plant depends on how you treat it," Thaver said. 3. Find the right seed. Choose a cannabis seed that you prefer and maintain the seed according to it's specific preferences. "The centre uses organic methods to produce cannabis, so if anyone needs advice, we can help them out," he added. The ruling, Thaver said, would lead to new industries booming in the country. He said: "Cannabis is a versatile plant, and it's going to do a lot for the economy in the long run because of the industries that can be built around it." SUNDAY TRIBUNE
