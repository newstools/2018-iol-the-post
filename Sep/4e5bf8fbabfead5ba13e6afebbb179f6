Durban - The Minister of Labour will launch a R22 million project aimed at creating employment in aviation, maritime commercial diving and agricultural sectors. The Minister of Labour, Mildred Oliphant, will officially launch the training programmes on Monday. The projects are being undertaken through a partnership agreement between the Dr John Langalibalele Dube Institute (JLDI) and the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF), an entity of the Department of Labour. The UIF, through its Labour Activation Programmes (LAP) has set aside R22 million for the three projects for beneficiaries – most of which are former contributors to the UIF who lost their jobs – to undergo theoretical and practical learnerships in aviation, maritime commercial diving, and organic farming. At Durban’s Virginia Airport, 50 beneficiaries will undergo an intensive pilot training which includes night rating, commercial pilot license, instrument rating, general radio license, and instructors rating. The maritime commercial diving project in Scottsburgh, south of KwaZulu-Natal, targets 50 beneficiaries to be trained on scuba diving, underwater welding, plumbing, photography, and filmmaking, amongst others. In Emandungeni, 100 rural women will be trained and grouped into a cooperative to plant and grow organic fruit and vegetables. The main market of their produce is major chain stores and some have already shown interest in procuring the produce of the project. Daily News
