Durban - Five years, four months and six days. That's how long the family of murdered Pietermaritzburg doctor Bhavish Sewram has waited for justice. "We have been counting the days we had to wait until judgment was handed down and we are pleased that it has finally happened. "It will never bring our only son, but it is closure for us," said Bhavish's father Parmanand Sewram. Bhavish, a medical doctor, was gunned down outside his practice in Chota Motala Road in May 2013. RajiveeÂ Soni, a businessman was arrested shortly thereafter as the mastermind behind the shooting. He was found guilty on six counts, including murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Soni believed his wife was having an affair with Sewram. The 69-year-old retired principal said that he had attended court for the past 5 years and was present on the day judgment was delivered on Wednesday. "It hasn't been easy but we feel like a burden has been lifted." Sewram said his granddaughters, aged 9 and 10, were aware of the incident. "Their mother broke the news to them shortly after the judgment." He said he is hoping that an appropriate sentence is meted out to Soni. Sentencing is expected to take place at the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Friday. Daily News
