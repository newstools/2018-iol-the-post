Durban - THREE of the five people accused of conspiring to murder Bluff money lender Narend Anandrai have been acquitted, while the remaining two were found guilty of murder.    Veronica Rathilal, 48, Chatsworth attorney Jayshree Baijnath, 43, and businesswoman Shana Mangroo, 48, were each acquitted after Durban High Court  judge, Peter Olsen, found there was not enough evidence to convict them.    Former policeman Dhanaseelan Manickam, 47, and businessman Rajendran “Trevor” Chetty, 48, were, however, "not impressive" witnesses.    The accused were implicated after self-confessed hitman Gregory Pillay pleaded guilty to shooting Anandrai, who was seated in his Mercedes-Benz sports car in Havenside, Chatsworth, on March 18, 2014.    The car burst into flames after hitting a wall.    Olsen found that Pillay could not accurately describe Baijnath, Mangroo and Rathilal and an identity parade should have been held instead of relying solely on his evidence.    He took into account that Pillay was addicted to heroine and consumed the substance before and after the incident; concluding that his memory could have been distorted.    He found Chetty and Manickam to have premeditated the murder and acted in furtherance of common purpose.    POST
