Durban - Durban vlogger, Chanté Shunmugam, has issued a heartfelt thank you to those who supported her #WorldSuicidePreventionDay initiative hosted at the pier in uMhlanga on Monday. Having personally experienced a loss of a loved one to suicide, Shunmugam took to social media to rally people together.  “I lost my mom seven years ago to suicide. Suicide and depression are two topics that are very close to my heart. Yesterday (Monday) was World Suicide Prevention Day. It was the first time that the event was hosted. I am hoping to do something to commemorate the day every year. It is time that we all do more,” she said. The idea was for people to gather at the pier to light a candle in memory of those who have taken their lives and show support for those who are battling depression. “We want them to know that we are here,” she said.
