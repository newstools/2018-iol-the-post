Durban - A Durban family who were victims of a home invasion on Thursday, escaped unharmed due to quick thinking by their neighbours. A man arrived at his Umgeni Park home and drove into his driveway. When he tried to close the gate, it wouldn't close. Andreas Mathios, from Blue Security, said the resident didn't notice anyone near his property. "Suddenly two men wearing balaclavas and armed with what appeared to be shotguns or rifles appeared at the gate,” said Mathios. “A further three balaclava-clad suspects, armed with firearms and crowbars, ran into the property. The suspects forced the resident and his wife and children into the house where they demanded cash and jewellery and to know where the safe was kept,” added Mathios. While the family feared for their safety, a vigilant neighbour noticed the armed suspects at the driveway gate and informed a male neighbour, who then drove to the home and repeatedly pressed the hooter. “The suspects ran out of the house and jumped into a white Mercedes Benz A Class. They fled the scene with cash and jewellery. Fortunately, no injuries were reported,” said Mathios. In a separate incident, a resident in Durban North was hijacked in Mount Edgecombe late last night. According to Mathios the residents pulled into his driveway when four suspects ambushed him. “They forced him to get out of his vehicle and lie on the ground. The suspects then banged on the front door of the house but did not gain entry before fleeing in the hijacked vehicle.” The vehicle was later recovered in KwaMashu by the SAPS Phoenix Crime Prevention Unit.
