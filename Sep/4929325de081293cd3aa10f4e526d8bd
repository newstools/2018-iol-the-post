Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance’s spokesperson on community safety and liaison in KwaZulu-Natal, Dr Rishigen Viranna, has lambasted the government for failing to protect women and children. He was reacting to the release of the latest crime statistics, which were read out in Parliament on Tuesday. Viranna said the stats painted a shocking picture in KZN with the province once again being dubbed the 'murder capital' of the country and the highest number of women and children reported killed in the entire country. "We are deeply disturbed by these horrific figures. They point to a province under siege with a theme of violent crime, in particular against women and children. KZN residents continue to live in a war zone," he said. Daily News
