Durban - Durban dentist Anwar Jeewa and nurse Zamangwane Hlongwane, accused of negligently causing the death of a foreigner, appeared briefly in the Pinetown Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Jeewa and Hlongwane face culpable homicide charges after Canadian man Milos Martinovic died at Jeewa's illegal rehab centre in Westville in November 2017. The rehab facility, Mind's Alive, is allegedly unlicensed. In January, The Mercury reported that the 26-year-old Canadian man flew to South Africa to undergo treatment for his alleged prescription drug addiction in November 2017, and died two days later. A post-mortem revealed that he had overdosed on Alprazolam (Xanax). Jeewa is out on R20 000 bail, while Hlongwane is out on R3 000 bail. Jeewa, who lives in Sherwood, was arrested by the Hawks. During Jeewa's bail application, Lieutenant-Colonel Anton Booysen told the court he believed the Canadian man died as a result of poor screening, an incorrect diagnosis and the wrongful administration of ibogaine. The matter was transferred to the Durban Regional Court for December. Daily News
