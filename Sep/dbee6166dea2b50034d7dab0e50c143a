Durban - Roshan Ramburan hopes to complete 100 000 crunches in 17 hours, all in the name of charity.  Ramburan, 62, is hard at work and spends most of his day training his body in preparation for this feat. "Come February 1, 2019, I will be completing my task of 100 000 crunches in 17 hours for the Cancer Association of South Africa. Funds raised on the day will go a long way in furthering the organisation's mandate throughout the communities that they serve," he said. Ramburan, who lives in Rainham, Phoenix, began training at the age of 6 and said his main influence growing up, was his brother. "He inspired and guided me. Over the years, I visited the Shaolin Temple in Hong Kong, were I attained my Martial Arts honours. I then opened my own fitness company and am a trainer at local gyms.   Ramburan said having lost loved ones to cancer, the cause is close to his heart. He said he is hoping to raise R3 million for Cansa. The event will take place at the First Fitness Gym in Reservoir Hills.
