Durban - The mother of Baby X, accused of killing her three-year-old daughter in 2014, was found guilty of murder and child abuse at the Durban High Court on Thursday afternoon. The 35-year-old woman, dressed in a black top, appeared emotionless and stared ahead blankly when the judge read the verdict. Her own mother - the baby 's grandmother - was on trial with her until she died in custody in April this year. Judge Mohini Moodley in summarising the trial said the conduct of Baby X's mother exceeded the boundaries of chastisement. In November 2014, the weak, scarred body of the three-year-old girl from Havenside in Chatsworth was found at her home. She had allegedly been killed by her mother and grandmother following harrowing abuse. During the trial, Dr Sibusiso Ntsele told the Durban High Court that the cause of death was “blunt force trauma following fatal child abuse”. The State alleged that Baby X's grandmother had throttled her and repeatedly thrown her onto the ground. The following day, the mother allegedly hit the child with a high heel shoe, with her grandmother later joining in. On the same night, a plastic packet was placed over the child’s head before she went to sleep. She died the following day. The State alleged that the women also allegedly tortured Baby X’s 11-year-old brother and 8-year-old sister, allegedly beating them, forcing them to beg and assaulting them by pinching or beating their genitals. Baby X’s siblings have since been taken to a place of safety. The mother claims that following a car accident prior to Baby X's death, she was mentally impaired and currently has the mental capacity of a child between 9 and 16-years-old.
