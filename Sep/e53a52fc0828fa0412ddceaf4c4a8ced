Durban -  A book called Toxic City will be launched by the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance next Thursday. The book which was written by the organisation displays the health impact on the community by chemicals emitting companies in the south Durban area. SDCEA coordinator, Desmond D'Sa, said that pollution and the release of harmful chemicals into the atmosphere is a common occurrence to the residents and workers in the area. “Not only is this detrimental to our environment and the air we breathe, but it has had damaging impacts on the health and well-being of many residents in the area. “At the launch, residents will be made aware of some of the statistics obtained from the Cancer Registry, created by SDCEA, showing how these chemicals have affected the health and well-being of our communities,” he said. D’Sa added that there will be a panel discussion, with the panellists discussing these pressing issues. “They will discuss how we can hold these companies responsible for the poor health and pollution they are causing.” The launch will take place at the Austerville Community Hall, on September 13, on 9am.
