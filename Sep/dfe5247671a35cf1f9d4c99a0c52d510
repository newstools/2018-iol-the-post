Durban - MORE than 1 000  students are expected to graduate at the Durban University's Spring Graduation set to take place later this week. DUT spokesperson Alan Khan said the university would host five ceremonies between Thursday and Friday where the 1117 certifications would be conferred. A total of 7877 students graduated from DUT earlier this year. From the September graduations, a total of 493 female and 624 male graduates are set to graduate. Four pioneers in Visual and Performing Arts sector will receive honorary doctorates, including Dr Esther Mahlangu, Johnny Clegg, Welcome Bhodloza Nzimande and Sipho Mchunu. "Dr Mahlangu will be conferred in her recognition of her national and international reputation as an artist, and her contribution to the broader arts sector through her paintings and her promotion of the Ndebele heritage," said Khan. "Johnny Clegg and Sipho Mchunu will be honoured for their exceptional contribution towards Juluka and the crucial role that the band played in the social cohesion of South Africa. Juluka’s mass movement against apartheid has been recognised nationally and internationally." Nzimande is a renowned broadcaster with a focus in Maskandi music.
