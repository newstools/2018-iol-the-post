Durban - The ex-convict and alleged racist man who made headlines for calling President Cyril Ramaphosa the k-word is expected to make his formal bail application next week. Kessie Nair applied for bail in the Verulam Magistrates Court on Thursday, where he faces a charge of crimen injuria and inciting public violence. Nair was arrested by the Hawks at his home on Wednesday night. In the almost five-minute long video, Nair demands that Ramaphosa be charged for failing the nation and calls the president the k-word, among other things. “I Kessie Nair do hereby call for that (k-word) state president, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, be charged for (de)frauding this nation, for oppressing this nation, for high treason,” he said. Nair had said he was prepared to go to jail for his comments. Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said the case was postponed until September 26 for further investigations and a formal bail application. Bishop Ruben Philip, said the statements made by Nair were a "disgrace and an embarrassment to the Indian community". He said Nair's comments do not represent the thinking and attitude towards African or any other race group. The Mercury
