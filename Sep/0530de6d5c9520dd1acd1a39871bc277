Durban - Leon Schuster’s latest movie, Frank & Fearless is set for the big screen next month. The hilarious movie, set in Africa, will take its audience on a thrilling adventure of four loveable characters in the African bush. Schuster, who plays the part of Sonny Frank, an Insecure railway chef, teams up with a 10-year-old (played by Themba Ntuli) to kidnap the ambassador of a South East Asian country in an attempt to stop rhino slaughtering. They will be joined by two four-legged friends, Reini - a baby rhino and a faithful dog named dog. Speaking on his latest project, Schuster described it as an epic adventure between an old man and a loveable young boy. “It has a captivating storyline and the cutest baby rhino that will make you want to laugh and cry. It is a kickass visual comedy about villains that get outsmarted in the African bush. Come and experience this unforgettable journey on the big screen and don’t forget your tissues,” he said. The star-studded cast includes Kenneth Nkosi (Tsotsi), Khanyi Mbau (Happiness is a Four Letter Word), Jennifer Steyn (Madam and Eve) and David Dennis (Soul City). The film is set to release in local cinemas on November 23. POST
