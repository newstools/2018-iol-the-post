DURBAN - THE days of impunity for criminals who think they can murder people freely in KwaZulu-Natal are over, so says acting Premier Sihle Zikalala. This message was also repeated by Police Minister Bheki Cele at a press conference at the KZN Police Headquarters in Durban, where members of the security cluster had convened. Zikalala called for those who faced murder to be denied bail Earlier, Cele told media that in the two months that an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) that had been setup to investigate political killings had been formed, 28 suspects had been arrested and three others have already been sentenced. “There are 21 people in different custodies, two out on bail and four have been released following further investigations,” he said. Zikalala said the IMC had been doing a good job not only with the arrests, but also because they communicated with the provincial government. “There is a lesson that we can take from this team. It must be sustained so we can ensure the safety of KZN and the country,” said Zikalala. Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa Ngqakula also called for the public to have confidence in the police. “The message here is that this team of SAPS, the Hawks and the NPA working together is a good team. I am highly impressed. I am not saying the murders won't continue but they are making a difference and when they work well we must commend them. Just as when things go wrong we come down hard we must also commend them. Yes there is killing but something is being done," she said. Minister of State Security Agency, Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba also called for witnesses and whistle-blowers to come forward. “Without witnesses or informants what do we do. Witnesses are now protected. We are here to make sure there is no more killing.” THE POST
