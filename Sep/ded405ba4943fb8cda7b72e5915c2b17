Durban - Two months ago IFP MP Narend Singh said that said polling data and focus group research in SA shows that a considerable percentage of South Africans want the death penalty brought back. In an opinion piece published in The Post Newspaper, The Chief Whip in Parliament, saidÂ the IFP requested that this matter is placed before the Constitutional Review Committee for further public consultation, as to whether or not the death penalty should be reinstated. Shortly after the release of the crime statistics on Tuesday, Singh said issued a statement saying: "The deplorable state of crime in our country, particularly in regards to the murder rate is reason enough to get South Africans talking about the reinstatement of the capital punishment. "The IFP reiterates its call on the Joint Constitutional Review Committee to table our request for a debate on the reinstatement of capital punishment." Singh described National Police Minister General Bheki Cele's comments as the murder rate bordering on a "war zone" as immensely disturbing. "The chilling statistics and the increasing rate of violent crimes in our country begs the question if our current tactical, strategic and prevention systems are enough to deter criminals from committing these heinous crimes. The IFP believes that a national dialogue must be had around prevention." Singh said it is shocking that year on year we are faced with a number of increases in regards to kidnapping, farm murders and cash-in-transit heists. Daily News
