Durban - Durban drivers are the worst drivers nationally. Compared to drivers across the country, Durban drivers fared the worst with driving behaviour measuring 11% below Cape Town drivers. The findings were released by Discovery Vitality who monitored the behaviour of Vitality members in parts of the country over the last three years. Head of Vitality Wellness, Dr Craig Nossel, said there were two main behaviours that caused significant illness and deaths amongst South Africans. “The statistics are staggering. More than five million deaths could be avoided each year if people moved regularly. More than 1.25 million people die in road accidents every year – that’s 3 425 people a day. Added to this, between 20 and 50 million people suffer non-fatal injuries, and many become disabled. But, we can improve these statistics,” Nossel said. He said drivers need to start understanding their behaviour and work to create a better environment that encourages healthier lifestyles and better driving. From data collected over 2016, 2017 and 2018, Cape Town fared the best in physical activity and driving behaviour across SA cities. Durban fared the worst nationally when it came to better driving. Cape Town topped the list of better drivers with Port Elizabeth, Bloemfontein, Johannesburg and Pretoria following closely behind.  Daily News
