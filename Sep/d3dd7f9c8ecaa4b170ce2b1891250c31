Ebrahim Saloojee, 73, and his wife Shahida, 66, were travelling on the R558 from Azaadville to Lenasia, Gauteng, last Wednesday when they were attacked. “While driving I noticed this mob of people blocking the road. I opened the window slightly and one of the men said I should give him R10 and he would let me go through,” Saloojee said. “I realised that he was not going to let me through and I could be in more danger if I opened my door or came out of the car.” The grandfather of seven said he opted to drive off. “As I drove through the mob I heard my back window being shattered. The angry mob started stoning our vehicle. My wife was hysterical. One rock came through her side of the window, passed her head and hit me on my arm.” Saloojee said he drove through the mob and then into the township and back to Azaadville to their relatives for help. “My arm was bruised but I was thankful my wife was not hit on the head. It was an important day for us and the Almighty was definitely protecting us, there is no doubt about that.” He said all he could think about was getting out of the situation. “To be attacked in that manner and being an elderly couple it was a very traumatic and scary experience. This is a growing problem in our country. All over South Africa we are hearing about these rock throwing incidents and something needs to be done to bring this to an end.” Saloojee urged other motorists to be vigilant at all times. Lenasia police spokesperson Kay Makhubela said the incident was being investigated. POST See page 3
