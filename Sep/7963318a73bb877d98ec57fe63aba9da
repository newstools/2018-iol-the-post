The gown was first worn by the eldest grandchild of the Sharma Sampath family - Dane Prakasem, now aged 32 - at their Inanda Road house, in a ceremony attended by 300 guests. Three decades later, the same gown was worn by Dane’s first daughter, the first great grandchild of the Sampath family, at her christening in oThongathi. A relative, Ashika Manickum, whose three children had also worn the gown, said it had sentimental value: “It is now a family heirloom and in pristine condition. It has been safely stored and still has its colour and beauty.” She added that the gown was priceless and irreplaceable, and that it still reduced her to tears when a new baby wore it. “As a family, we feel incredibly fortunate to have been able to pass the gown down through so many people.” The silk gown was hand-made by a dressmaker in Chatsworth in February 1986. “It was made for Dane and 10 other grandchildren wore it for their christenings. The first great grandchild used it on September 2.” She said she hoped the younger generations held the tradition dear: “It is one of the things in life, you simply cannot put a price tag to.” POST
