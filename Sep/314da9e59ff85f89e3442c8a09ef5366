The festival will take place from Friday to Sunday with Naidoo's performance on Saturday at 2 pm. He has showcased his talents throughout the world and continues to push the boundaries of his musical imagination. Our Song is a solo piano and track performance where he transcribed some of Mandela's most iconic speeches. The words of the speeches are “pitch-classed” and harmonised to create a musical backdrop to these important pieces. In his only appearance at this year's festival, Naidoo wrote new compositions especially to complement his performance. “In all honesty, I don't know of other iconic speeches having been transcribed into original music,” admits Naidoo. “Growing up, I used to hear of this name, Nelson Mandela. My dad was a politician, so I remember him mentioning Mandela's name often in conversations with my mother and friends. “I think that I was already intrigued by this man, who I had not even seen up to that point. I somehow knew this was an important person.” Burton said he was 10-years-old when Madiba was released from prison. “I remember watching the footage on TV at home. I had many questions at the time.” The idea to transcribe the speeches, he added, started in 2006. “I have always been able to hear the melody in people's voices. “Speech has the same construct as a piece of music, phrasing, punctuation, articulation, rhythm and even key. I remember thinking that there's no better person to explore this concept on, than the words of Mr Mandela.” He hopes to perform the song at other festivals around the country and internationally. “That is the plan. After all, ‘the brave man is not he that does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear’. That's my favourite quote from Mandela that encourages me to do more and try harder.” For more on the festival, visit www.hiltonfestival.co.za POST
