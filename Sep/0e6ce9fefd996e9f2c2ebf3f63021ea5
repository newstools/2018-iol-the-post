Durban - The eThekwini Municipality has suspended the controversial head of its legal services, Gideon Phungula, as it probes allegations that, among others things, he referred to Indian officials as c**lies. Phungula confirmed the suspension to The Mercury, today, saying while he maintains his innocence, he will not challenge it. “I was served with a suspension letter yesterday. I just said let me leave this otherwise when you challenge such things it looks like you are hiding something. I will allow the process to unfold,” he said. Phungula said the allegations against him were a fabrication. The city’s integrity and investigation unit launched the probe into the matter after two audio recordings of a telephone conversation were leaked to the media. In one of the clips, a man believed to be Phungula is heard telling a fellow colleague of his intentions to frustrate a disciplinary hearing against Zandile Sithole, a senior supply chain management official, currently on suspension for her alleged part in tender rigging. The man is heard saying that he is under pressure because the politicians want the official back at work. Phungula said he was not guilty of any wrongdoing and had not even heard the recordings. He said he hopes that he will return to work once the investigation into his conduct is complete. The Mercury
