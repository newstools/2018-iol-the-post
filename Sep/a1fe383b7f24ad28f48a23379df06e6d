Durban - An unwavering belief in oneself, was the key to success for Larrisa Singh, who graduated Cum Laude in a Bachelor of Technology Degree in Industrial Engineering, on Thursday. The Institution is hosting its spring graduation on Thursday and Friday. More than 1 000 students are expected to graduate. Reflecting on her results, Singh, 24, of Newlands West, said she made a lot of personal sacrifices over the years. “It required mindfulness, focus and discipline. What may have seemed as a sacrifice early on, became a healthy routine over time, and eventually didn't require much effort as the brain wires itself accordingly. "I also ensured that attention was given to my mental and physical health to be able to perform as optimally as possible,” said Singh. Singh, a merit student since primary school,  said passing Cum laude was a goal, she was determined to achieve despite deregistering from the University at one point due to health complications. “It was difficult to digest given the time that was being lost but I had to accept that the decision was made taking my best interests into consideration." Singh who is the youngest of three children, attributed her achievement to having immense support from her parents, lecturers and also having friends who share a similar vision. “My parents, my lecturers and my really good friends Saalick and Stuart - who also happened to be in my class and are also graduating Cum Laude. Everyone was amazing,” she said. In sharing words of wisdom to students who often come across challenges in their studies, she  said, “When you find yourself straying off and you begin to resent the idea of studying, change your outlook on it and appreciate the opportunity you have- not so many are as fortunate.” Singh plans to further her academic pursuits by venturing into research, however, admits that the "learning curve will never end".
