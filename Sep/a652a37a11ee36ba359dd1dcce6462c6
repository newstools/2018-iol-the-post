Durban - A Durban call centre agent accused of raping and murdering a 7-year-old Verulam orphan was denied bail in the Verulam Family and Child Court on Monday. The 26-year-old man, of Waterloo, in Verulam appeared calm as he made his appearance in court. He is facing charges of rape and murder after the little girl died in hospital in August. He cannot be named until he pleads. The grade two pupil who lived with her 60-year-old grandmother in Waterloo, sustained stab wounds and was found naked in a passage in Waterloo. She was taken to hospital, but later succumbed to her injuries. The accused will be remanded at Westville Prison. The matter was adjourned for November 29.  Protestors gathered outside court demanding justice for the little girl. A Verulam stepfather accused of allegedly raping his 10 year old stepdaughter will appear in court in October. He is accused of raping the girl more than 900 times. DAILY NEWS
