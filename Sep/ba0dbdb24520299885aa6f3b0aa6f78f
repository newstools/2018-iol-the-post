According to KZN police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, the 18-year-old mother had given birth at a hospital and had boarded a taxi from Hlabisa Hospital to Mtubatuba.  "It is alleged that the suspect who was sitting behind the mother, requested to carry the one-day-old new born baby girl. The mother agreed as she appeared to be sympathetic."  Zwane said on arrival at the Mtubatuba taxi rank, the woman asked the mother to buy airtime from a nearby shop and promised to wait for her. "On her return from the shop the mother realised that the woman and her new-born baby were nowhere to be found."  Zwane said the matter was reported to Mtubatuba police station for investigation.  On Monday night, the Mtubatuba community proceeded to Makhambane area after receiving information about a women who was found in possession of a new-born baby that was not hers.  "Police were contacted and the woman was handed over to the police who placed her under arrest. After the baby was found and the suspect was positively identified by the mother of the stolen baby as the same person who stole her child."  The baby was taken to a health facility for a check-up.  Police are appealing to parents to take extra precautions when dealing with strangers.  "Parents should not hand over their babies to strangers.
