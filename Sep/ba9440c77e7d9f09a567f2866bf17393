Durban - Paramedics had their hands full this weekend as a number of accidents took place across KZN. In the early hours of Saturday morning, a man burnt to death after his car caught alight on the M4 near Blue Lagoon;  while another person was killed when two cars collided on the M4 near the Sibaya Precinct on Saturday morning. According to Garrith Jamieson of Rescue Care paramedics, one person died and 17 others were injured after a taxi and a vehicle collided on Inanda Road just past the Waterfall Centre on Saturday night around 5 pm. "A taxi and a bakkie collided head-on before the taxi veered off the road. Unfortunately, one person had sustained major injuries and there was nothing more paramedics could do, and he was declared deceased on the scene. "A further seventeen people had sustained various injuries and was stabilized on the scene before being transported to various Durban Hospitals for the further care that they required." Another head-on collision on Bellair Road, near Cato Manor, claimed the life of one person and left 4 others seriously injured. According to Jamieson, the accident occurred just before midnight on Saturday. "Two vehicles had collided head-on leaving both drivers entrapped in the wreckage." Jamieson said a male believed to be in his forties had sustained major injuries and died on scene. "In the second vehicle, four occupants had sustained serious injuries and were stabilised on the scene by Advanced Life Support Paramedics before being transported to various Durban Hospitals for the further care that they required. The Durban Fire Department used the Jaws of Life to cut the drivers free." He said the road was closed. Daily News
