Durban - National police minister, Bheki Cele, is expected to meet with the family of Miguel Louw on Friday. Cele’s visit comes after DNA tests confirmed that the body found in a shallow grave in Phoenix last week Monday, belonged to Miguel. On Wednesday, police officially confirmed the outcome of the DNA tests. Miguel was allegedly kidnapped by a man, known to the family, on July 17. The almost two month search drew to a heartbreaking close when police and security guards discovered Miguel’s decomposing body buried in a thicket in Longbury Drive, Phoenix. At the time officials were searching for a gang of robbers when they noticed a foul stench emanating from the bushes. DNA samples were taken from Miguel’s parent, Kurt and Raylene and on Wednesday, police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele announced that the body belonged to Miguel. On Thursday night, a wake was held at the family’s home in Sydenham. Miguel’s funeral will take place on Saturday at the St Anne’s Parish in Randles Road. Cele’s visit follows his media briefing held at the KZN police headquarters where he addressed journalists about the last developments made in the investigations into police killings. Daily News
