Durban - Two men, arrested during a raid in Chatsworth, are expected to apply for bail this week. The pair made their first appearance in the Chatsworth Magistrate's Court on Monday and were remanded into police custody. According to police, officers were granted a search warrant for the property. During the search, officers found drugs, including mandrax tablets and rock cocaine with a street value of R1.3 million. In two separate incidents last week, four people were also arrested for allegedly dealing in drugs. On Friday, two women from Malukazi near Isipingo were found with 789 capsules of mandrax and 150 heroin tablets on them. The street value was R60 000 and according to police, the drugs were already packaged and ready for distribution. On the same day, two others were arrested with drugs in Margate with a street value of R20 000. Sam Pillay from the Anti-Drug Forum said he is very excited at the recent drug busts. "It's been a long time since we heard of a bust as big as a million rand but it shows it's a step in the right direction. It shows people are serious about doing away with drugs and I hope these kinds of busts continue." POST
