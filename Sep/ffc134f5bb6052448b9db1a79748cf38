The incident had initially been thought to be a hijacking, but it emerged in the Durban Magistrate's Court that the suspect only faced charges of theft, kidnapping and two counts of murder - for the death of Sadia and one of the suspects who was killed at the scene. Members of the Chatsworth community said at the time they had been attacked with stun grenades and rubber bullets. About 20 people were arrested and charged. Many were injured. One of those who was injured at the time was Rennie Govender, 63, who lost his chance to run for his 20th Comrades Marathon medal when a tear-gas canister fired into the crowd broke his shin bone, the Sunday Tribune reported at the time. “I doubt I will ever run again,” said the grandfather at the time. Following a community Imbizo held in Chatsworth, the community raised concerns about the heavy-handed actions of the police and the high levels of crime in Bottlebrush, Chatsworth and Shallcross. Cele established a fact-finding committee. This committee comprises of members from the Civilian Secretariat for Police (CSPS), the Department of Community Safety and Liaison, and the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID).
