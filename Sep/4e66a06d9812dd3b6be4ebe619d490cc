Durban - A Westville teenager who had just returned home from school on Thursday, was held at gunpoint by a group of armed robbery suspects. Andreas Mathios said the teenager was alone in his Byron Road home when the robbers invaded the property at around 3.30pm. He said the teenager's grandfather was at the neighbour's house at the time. "A gang of four suspects, two of them armed with firearms, derailed the driveway gate and reversed their vehicle, a grey Mercedes S200 into the property," Mathios said. Mathios said the gang forced open the front door and held the teen at gunpoint and asked him for the safe before removing it from the wall. "They loaded a cellphone, a laptop and other goods into their vehicle." He said the teen's grandfather activated the panic alarm and the suspects fled the scene. "No injuries were reported although the boy was left traumatised after the incident. Westville police attended the scene of the crime," Mathios added. KZN SAPS spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that a case of house robbery is being investigated by Westville SAPS. "it is alleged that the victim was at his place of residence when he noticed an unknown vehicle parking at the gate. Three armed suspects wearing balaclavas alighted. The victim locked himself in the bedroom and the suspects kicked it open. At gunpoint the suspects robbed him of laptop, jewellery, safe and cellphone before fleeing the scene in their getaway vehicle." A group of children and a gardener were also held up at gunpoint by armed robbers during another home invasion in Sherwood recently. POST
