Durban - National police minister Bheki Cele urged parents to take responsibility for their children's safety, particularly that they always know of their children's whereabouts. Cele was speaking at the memorial held in Sydenham on Friday morning for 9-year-old Miguel Louw who went missing 2 months ago and whose body was found and identified by police this week. "Parents must be extra vigilant when it comes toÂ access to their children. We need to enhance preventative measures rather than being reactive. It's not up to educators to ensure safety, it's not up to police to ensure safety and we are calling on all parents to co-ordinate to make our schools safer," said Cele, who said the case remains sub judice but that the current suspect in the case may be charged with murder. Although the suspect was granted bail on charges of kidnapping at his last court appearance, he remains behind bars as he did not pay the bail amount. He is due to appear again in court on Monday.
