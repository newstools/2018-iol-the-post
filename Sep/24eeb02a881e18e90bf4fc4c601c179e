Durban - The Phoenix mother and her boyfriend charged with attempted murder of 4-year-old Baby G are expected to appear in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. The 25-year-old woman is accused of brutally beating her daughter while her 20-year-old boyfriend recorded it on his cellphone. The video which went viral on social media in March led to the couple's arrest. In the video, a woman is seen smacking, kicking and stomping on the child almost 46 times, while shouting vulgarities at her, for allegedly wetting the bed. Angry community members torched the 20-year-old man’s car, forcing him and his family to flee their home and close their business. At every court proceeding community members stage protests outside the family courthouse demanding justice. Both are out on bail. As part of her bail conditions, the mother is allowed to communicate with the child. Baby G spent more than a month in hospital. She sustained injuries to her legs, arms and body and was unable to walk for weeks. She now lives with relatives. POST
