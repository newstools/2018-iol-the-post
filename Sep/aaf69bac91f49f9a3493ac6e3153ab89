Gluckstad SAPS station commander, Captain Karl Erasmus, confirmed last night that the search for the elusive lions would continue for the next few days. “They have been in the area for about three months and have killed three cattle. Professional hunters with trackers and tracking dogs, as well as a light aircraft, have been looking for them, but they are avoiding being located. It is a very big area and mountainous,” said Erasmus. He said they would like to track and dart the animals and not see the lions being harmed in any way. The lions were reportedly seen crossing the road close to the local garage at about 5am by a truck driver. It is thought they escaped from a nearby game reserve. “We are urging the community not to confront these animals, but if you spot them, contact Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife or the nearest police station,” said Erasmus.
