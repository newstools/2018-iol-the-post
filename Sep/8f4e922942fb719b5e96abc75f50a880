Durban - Social grant beneficiaries are urged to withdraw their monies using the new gold South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) card or personal bank account to access their funds from Saturday, September 29. In a statement issued today, Sassa communications and marketing assistant manager, Mdumiseni Hadebe, said the notice is for those beneficiaries who either withdraw their grants through banks or using a PIN. Hadebe, said the old Sassa card expires at the end of September. “The new Sassa card is an improvement of the old card and it does not allow deductions for things such as airtime, loans or prepaid electricity among others,” Hadebe said. Hadebe said the new card also allows three free cash withdrawals at points of sale, one free withdrawal at the post office per month, free swipes at points of sale and it is accepted by all ATM’s displaying the VISA sign.
