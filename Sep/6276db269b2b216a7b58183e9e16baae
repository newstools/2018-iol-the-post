Durban - The Democratic Alliance Women’s Network (DAWN) in KZN will hold a peaceful protest outside Phoenix SAPS on Tuesday morning. According to Shehana Kajee, DA Women’s Network Chairperson, the intention of the protest was to draw attention to the trafficking and killing of children. Speaking to Daily News ahead of the protest, Kajee said the reason Phoenix was chosen was because a body of a little boy, believed to be that of Miguel Louw, was found in a vacant land in Phoenix last Monday. Kajee said that child abduction was on the increase and criminals were becoming more brazen, snatching children from under their parent's noses. "Previously children used to be enticed with sweets and ice creams. We have to create awareness with both parents and children." Kajee together with other DA councilors will deliver a written plea to SAPS to put in place stringent measures and plans to deal with this phenomenon. "The appeal will be received by Phoenix Station Commander, Captain Bafana Ndlovu," said Kajee. Daily News
