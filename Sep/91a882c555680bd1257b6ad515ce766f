Durban - A  mother and child had to be airlifted to hospital after they were trampled by a giraffe on a farm in Hoedspruit, Limpopo on Tuesday afternoon. ER24 spokesperson,Russel Meiring, said paramedics were alerted to the incident after the Hoedspruit Medical Rescue arrived on the scene and assessed the patients. "Assessments showed that the mother, believed to be in her 30s, as well as a 3-year-old boy, had sustained numerous injuries and were both in a critical condition." Meiring said both the mother and child were treated for their injuries by Hoedspruit Medical Rescue. " Thereafter they were rushed to a nearby airfield where the two ER24 Oneplan Helicopters were waiting. "Further treatment and advanced life support interventions were initiated, in an effort to stabilize the patient’s vital signs." Once treated, Meiring said, the two patients were airlifted to Busamed Modderfontein for urgent treatment.

Hodge, 67, suffered serious injuries and the lion, Shamba, was reportedly shot after the attack. POST
