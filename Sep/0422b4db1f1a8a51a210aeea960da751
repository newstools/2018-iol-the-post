Durban - In keeping with an undertaking he made to turn the tide of corruption, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced he had authorised the Special Investigating Unit to investigate suspected wrongdoing in the awarding of tenders. During his state of the nation address, Ramaphosa said “this is the year in which we will turn the tide of corruption in our public institutions”. Regarding eThekwini Municipality, the SIU has been authorised to investigate the allegedly irregular award of a tender for the supply to the municipality of waste recycling bags. This investigation will look into alleged fraudulent and any related unauthorised, irregular or fruitless and wasteful expenditure, underperformance or non-performance by contractors, and the conduct of directors of the company or companies involved in this tender. Government also confirmed that The Media, Information and Communication Technologies Sector Education and Training Authority (MICT SETA) would also be investigated for alleged maladministration, in relation to the allocation of discretionary grant funding to a number of companies. Ramaphosa also made it clear in the State of the Nation Address that the commission of inquiry into state capture headed by Deputy Chief Justice Judge Raymond Zondo, would not displace the regular work of the country’s law enforcement agencies in investigating and prosecuting any, and all acts of corruption. The investigation will focus on a period between January 2015 and the present, although unlawful or improper conduct prior to January 2015 that is deemed relevant to this matter would be taken into account.
