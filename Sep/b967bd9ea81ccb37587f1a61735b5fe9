Durban - The ANC said it was shocked and saddened by the death of two students at universities in KZN at the weekend. In the first incident a 22-year-old student was stabbed to death at a residence in the early hours at University of KwaZulu-Natal's Westville campus, on Saturday morning, KZN police said. In a separate incident, gruesome videos have emerged of a reported University of Zululand student being assaulted by a mob after allegedly killing another at a residence on Sunday afternoon. "As the African National Congress in KwaZulu-Natal our thoughts and prayers are with the families and the loved ones of the deceased," said Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu, ANC Provincial Spokesperson. "The ANC is deeply concerned about the sudden rise of violence in our tertiary institutions. "It goes without saying that our educational institutions must be places of intellectual learning and not of violence and murders." Simelane-Zulu called on the recently launched Provincial Council on Social Cohesion and Moral Regeneration, co-chaired by Premier Cde Willies Mchunu and Bishop Emeritus Rubin Phillip, to give special attention to this violent behavior at institutions of higher learning. "We also call on law enforcement agencies and the university management at these institutions to speedily investigate and bring the alleged perpetrators of this weekend murders to justice." Simelane-Zulu said the role of universities was to produce the human resources capacity for the development of the nation. Minister of Police Bheki Cele is expected to visit the University of Zululand on Tuesday morning. Daily News
