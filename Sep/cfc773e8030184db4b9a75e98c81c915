Durban - Democratic Alliance Constituency chairperson in Ilembe, Dean Macpherson is hoping to meeting with police top dogs to address the crime crisis in Stanger, north of Durban. Macpherson said he has requested an urgent meeting with Police Minister, Bheki Cele and Justice Minister, Michael Masutha, in order to map out a plan to restore order in Stanger. He said during a parliamentary session, it was revealed that between the Stanger police and courts, there has been a 1.4% conviction rate for murder, rape, robbery, hijacking and housebreaking. "When one looks at each category specifically the figures are more alarming, including a conviction rate for murder of 2.7%, rape of 6% and hijacking of 0%," he said. In June, the DA conducted an oversight insepction to the Stanger police station.Â According to Macpherson, management did not engage with the team. "It is now clear that there is a crisis in Stanger that requires urgent national intervention to restore law and order in this community. The people of Stanger live in constant fear that they will be victims of violent crimes without a police service to assist them and a justice system that will prevent criminals from roaming the streets," he said.
