Durban - KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, who was among the mourners at the memorial service of slain pregnant nurse, Nelisa “Mu” Cele, on Thursday, has urged police to continue working hard towards solving the murder. "We would like to thank the police for the work that they have done, and wish to urge them to find the perpetrator/s of this callous act," said Dhlomo. He also expressed his dismay and concern at the rampant acts of violence against women. Cele who would have celebrated her 32nd birthday on Monday, was expected to give birth in December. Mourners at her memorial service gasped in shock as details of her post-mortem emerged, including that she was struck with a blunt object on the head and sustained extensive internal bleeding. Cele’s lifeless body was discovered by a birdwatching Johannesburg tourist at Oribi Gorge last Friday, where it had been thrown halfway down a cliff. It is alleged that after capturing an image of a bird and then taking a closer look at it, he noticed what looked like a human figure. Upon further investigation, the tourist confirmed that it was indeed a human body, and then alerted the SAPS. Dhlomo said when the post-mortem was done, they found a baby girl who was lifeless. "You then have even more anger and pain… Why would a person kill another, who already has a soul to save? We are affected (by these murders) as the Department of Health, because a large number of our staff members are females." Cele will be laid to rest at her place of birth, Gamalakhe township, near Port Shepstone on Saturday. POST
