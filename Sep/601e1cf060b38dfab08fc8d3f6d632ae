Durban - KwaZulu Natal police have cautioned the public to be aware of possible jobs scams after 12 people were allegedly defrauded into paying for a teaching post at a school in Empangeni. According to Captain Nqobile Gwala, it is alleged that these teaching posts were advertised on social media. “The advert required candidates to deposit an amount of R2 850 into a money market account. After applicants deposited the requested cash amount they discovered that they were scammed. "A case of fraud has been opened at Empangeni police station after twelve people claimed that they were defrauded of more than R34 000.” Gwala added while unemployment was high and people are trying to secure jobs, they must not pay any money for job opportunities. “Do not pay any money for job opportunities in government as this is not a requirement. "Applicants must also do their research and satisfy themselves that the job opportunities advertised are real and not fake. We are also appealing to anyone else who was defrauded to come forward and submit their statement to the investigating officer.” Victims can contact the Empangeni SAPS station commander, Brigadier Thango on 035 901 5805/6.
