Durban - The city has issued a warning to pensioners regarding a new ploy by scam artists. According to acting head of communications in eThekwini Municipality, Mandla Nsele, pensioners are receiving phone calls by people pretending to work for the city. The pensioner is then offered a rebate for water meters. Nsele said the caller issues a reference number to the resident and informs them that they will be contacted by another official in the coming days and a form would need to be completed and signed to qualify for the rebate. "We can confirm that there is no such process nor under any circumstances will customers be asked to make on the spot cash payments. The only rebate currently offered by the municipality is a rates rebate and no other service," he said. Nsele explained that property owners qualify for the rebate on their primary property when they turn 60. "This rebate is renewed annually. Both new application forms and renewal forms are found on the municipal website. All rebate renewal forms are completed and submitted to our Municipal offices. Payments are made strictly only via our Municipal banking halls, Sizakala centres and or our third party collectors indicated on the bill. Any new application by a pensioner can be done at any of the customer service centre or downloaded via www.durban.gov.za and submitted via email or at one of the municipal customer or Sizakala centres," he said. He warned customers to be vigilant and avoid falling prey to criminals posing as municipal employees. "Any representative of the municipality will have an ID tag with a photograph, ID or employee number with the municipal logo," he said. If residents are suspicious of anything, they can contact our toll free number 080 311 11 11 or http://correspondence.durban.gov.za:200/ , or City Investigation Unit on 0800 20 20 20 or the nearest police station.
