Durban - Kessie Nair has told reporters at his bail application that he does not believe he should be sent to a mental facility. Nair was speaking during a break in court proceedings earlier on Wednesday.      He is appearing at the Verulam Magistrate’s Court on charges on six counts of crimen injuria and two counts of incitement and instigation.      At the start of proceedings, an affidavit submitted by a District Surgeon suggested that Nair be sent to Fort Napier for 28 days for observation. Nair’s brothers and ex-wife also submitted affidavits attesting to the ex-convict’s mental state.      However, he maintained that he did not have mental issues.  The Mercury
