Durban - KwaZulu-Natal police were commended for killing three armed robbers during a shoot-out on the N2 Freeway on Tuesday.  Acting Provincial Commissioner for KwaZulu-Natal, Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi commended the police for their proactive approach in dealing with armed robberies in the province.  This after three men, linked to various robberies including a cash heist were killed in a gunfight with police on the N2 Freeway on the North Coast. Police allege the men were on their way to commit a robbery when they were intercepted.  “We wish to caution criminals not declare war on police as they will be on the losing end. They should not test our capabilities when they are caught with guns in their hands. If they are confronted by police, we are advising them to put down their guns and surrender peacefully,” Mkhwanazi said.  According to police, on Monday, various police specialised units responded to intelligence with regards to a planned armed robbery in the province.  Police spotted a car fitting the same description given to them with three occupants along the N2 near Mandeni.  When police attempted to pull over the car, the occupants allegedly opened fire on the police officers.  Three suspects were killed during the shootout with police.  "Fortunately no police officers were injured during the shooting," police spokesman, Brigadier Jay Naicker said.  The car was searched and three unlicensed firearms, as well as ammunition, were recovered.  The suspects were also found in possession of R100 000 in cash.  According to detectives the suspects were wanted for a number of armed robberies in the province. It is believed that they were also part of a group who shot and injured a police officer during an attempted cash-in-transit robbery that was foiled by police in Empangeni last month.  Daily News
