Durban - The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) said it was gravely concerned by the discovery of a fake Facebook Page associating itself to them. According to the Brigadier General Mafi Mgobozi, from the Defence Corporate Communication, the Facebook page is called  “South African National Defence Force – Media. "The page was created on 22 April 2018 by unknown sources. The SANDF vehemently distances itself from this scandalous and illegal Facebook Page. "The creators of this page have used images of an aircraft and a vessel similar to current SANDF equipment. This is seen as an ill-intended ploy to mislead the general public into accepting this page as an official Facebook Page of the SANDF. The SANDF has reported this Page as a scam to the relevant Facebook administrators to have it removed." The official SANDF Facebook page is “SA National Defence Force - @sandfcorpevents. The public is warned not to engage or to be misled by the content of this bogus Facebook Page purporting to be the official Facebook Page of the SANDF. DAILY NEWS
