Lingestivaren Govender, of KwaDukuza, and her daughter walked in on a farm employee who was in their kitchen, allegedly intending to steal something, after her husband had gone out to work in the fields at 6am. He allegedly attacked Govender. IPSS Medical Rescue’s Paul Herbst said: “The mother flung herself in front of the attacker to protect her child. “The mother sustained serious injuries while her daughter was able to hide inside the house and was not physically harmed. “The assailant left the home after the mother and her daughters alerted neighbours of their plight by screaming.” Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that the suspect was known to the family and that they were looking for him. “A known suspect entered the farm in the Darnall area, where he attacked the woman with a cane knife. “She sustained head and body injuries and was taken to hospital for medical attention,” Gwala said. “A case of attempted murder has been opened for investigation at the KwaDukuza SAPS.
