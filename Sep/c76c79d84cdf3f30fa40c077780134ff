“From WhatsApp to Facebook in the past month, the number of messages of abductions linked to child trafficking has been spiralling out of control. "This is only spreading unnecessary panic among parents and schools,” he said, adding it was understandable that people want to warn others, but advised that before hitting the send or post button, the authenticity should be confirmed. “We need to develop a toll-free number or WhatsApp group, which people can go to verify information before spreading fake news. As parents, we need to stop constantly sharing things on social media about the daily ongoings in our lives.” Padayachee said some users have their entire lives documented on social media, from what they eat to where they live and what cars they drive. There is no limit to what remains private, he said. “Giving out so much of information can make you an easy target for criminals. Posting pictures of your children in their school uniforms showing the school name is something that needs to be reconsidered, as one must be mindful that criminals also troll the internet looking for victims.” He said taking pictures of children from Facebook accounts was easy and passing them around to predators or child-trafficking rings could be done at the click of a button. “With all the information about one’s life posted on social media, finding the child becomes a breeze and in some cases, predators can use the information to lure the child or gain the child’s trust.” Padayachee advised red flags must go up when one sees adverts for people looking for models or offering employment. “Before getting into contact with the people offering these positions, verify the information first. Human traffickers use the glitz and glamour of being a model as a way to get victims, while some prey on people’s desperation to get a job.” POST
