Having braved the wind, cold and rain for his amazing feat (and feet) over 26 days to raise much-needed funds for pupils at his school, St James Preparatory, the 55-year-old Sanskrit teacher arrived to a hero’s welcome in Durban on Monday. The Lenasia resident, who started his trek to Durban on Women’s Day, August 9, said every child needed a sound education and the donations received would help provide bursaries for disadvantaged pupils at the school. “The children must grow into men and women of great character, who will serve and nourish their communities with their knowledge,” said Valab, after arriving at StJames Preparatory School on Mathews Meyiwa Road, Durban. He said he wore “good walking takkies”, which comprised of three pairs of Nike shoes that he changed after every 10km. “I walked for six days and rested on the seventh as my coach advised me that I needed to re-energise. “One of the challenges was the cold mornings where temperatures were sometimes below 2ºC in areas like Mtubatuba,” Valab said. “And I had to walk through mist and strong winds.” Valab, nevertheless, described the journey as “amazing”. “This is the start to many other great projects. My next aim is to do a coast-to-coast walk and I hope others will join in.” Valab said he was uncertain how much was raised and this would only be tallied when he returned home on Saturday. POST
