Durban - While Kessie Nair is due to appear in court this morning after a video surfaced on social media yesterday of him calling president Cyril Ramaphosa the K-word, the South African Muslim Network has condemned his utterances. Nair, an ex-convict, was arrested on Wednesday night at his home in Phoenix, by members of the Hawks after a case of crimen injuria was opened against him by community activist Brandon Pillay. In the almost five-minute long video, Nair demands that Ramaphosa is charged for failing the nation. He also said he was prepared to go to jail for his comments. In a statement released just after 9am, the network’s chairperson Dr Faisal Suliman says it “unequivocally condemns the abhorrent, bigoted and extremely rude” content of this video. “We believe that all South Africans would share our anger and disappointment that in this day and age, people still make videos of this nature. We are sure that the Human Rights Commission and the National Prosecuting Authority will act appropriately.” He added that hurtful and racist comment such as those made in the video must be dealt with in a way that sends a clear message to would be racists to prevent this from occurring again.
