Durban - Police have detained a 44-year-old man after he allegedly tried to sexually assault his stepdaughter at their home in Verulam on Monday morning. The 22-year-old woman woke up to find the man with his hands allegedly in her pants. According to Reaction Unit spokesperson, Prem Balram, the man was reportedly fondling the woman who then screamed for help. “At about 4am the suspect entered pretended to go to the toilet. He had been living in the outbuilding on the property and had entered the main house. When the woman woke up and screamed, he fled,” Balram said. He said a search was conducted and the man was found asleep at a petrol station, a distance away from his home. Following the man’s arrest, it was revealed that the man had sexually assaulted the woman when she was five years old. Balram said when she informed her mother, no charges were laid. “Her older sister also complained that he had tried to force himself onto her while she was in high school. Their mother confirmed that both girls had complained to her regarding their stepfather's actions. She failed to report the incidents to authorities because she feared for her safety due to her husband being extremely violent,” Balram said. The accused has since been handed over the police and a case of sexual assault has been registered against him. Daily News
