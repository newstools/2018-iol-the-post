Businessman and member of the Revolution Motorcycle Club Santosh Ramchuran, of Montford, was returning from a biking event with fellow riders when he apparently lost control near the Mariannhill Toll plaza while trying to avoid an accident. He died at the scene. The father-of-two, who would have celebrated his birthday on Monday, was a loved and respected member in his community, said club president Clive Pillay. On Tuesday, dozens of bikers from various clubs around the province arrived at the Clare Estate Crematorium in convoy to honour their friend. Pillay told POST that Ramchuran had joined the club about eight years ago and had assisted many underprivileged communities through the club’s charitable initiatives. “He was happy to bring people together and would share amazing and funny stories that would make others laugh. “We will remember him as an avid biker and at the funeral we celebrated his life, the brotherhood we shared and his passion for bikes,” he said.
