Durban - Children as young as six-years-old are having to navigate their way across the Mdloti River just to get to school. This was discovered during a recent oversight visit to the Ogunjini village just outside Verulam, north of Durban. Mzamo Billy of the Democratic Alliance Youth Provincial Executive Committee said the visit was conducted by councillor Chris Langa last week. Billy said for them the main concern was that young children were having to cross the river to get to school “Children as young as six are finding themselves in a compromising situation,” he said.  Billy said after discussions with locals they were told government officials had promised that a bridge would be erected over the river. “We were also told by pupils that when the river is full, some of them do not go to school. This means children are missing out on schooling,” he said. Billy said they will take up the matter with the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education through DA education spokesperson in KZN legislature, Rishigen Viranna. “We will ask him to question MEC Mthandeni Dlungwane and get urgent intervention. This is no right. We strongly condemn this injustice directed at the future of this province and country.  A river cannot be an impediment to the success of a young person,” he said. Daily News
