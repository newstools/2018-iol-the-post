Durban - Five people arrested in connection with the murder of Cottonlands couple Dhir 'Roy' Singh and his Kallawathie Beekarie appeared in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Thursday for a bail application. Singh, 68, and Beekarie, 64, were found dead in the bathroom on  September 3. Beekarie was strangled and found face down in the bathtub with her hands tied behind her back. Singh sustained a single stab wound to the neck. Their home was ransacked. The suspects aged between 16 and 30,  were arrested in Inanda, Ndwedwe and Cottonlands during an intelligence-driven operation last Tuesday. Thobelani Manquele, 20, Sphiwe Shezi, 18, Siyabonga Emmanuel Nhlengethwa, 30, Bonginkosi Freedom Mkhize, 30 and the 16-year-old minor face charges of murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances. The bail application was adjourned as one of the accused has requested the services of a private attorney. A nephew of Singh who lived in Phoenix, told POST he was devastated to hear of the murder as he was “very close” to his uncle. “Justice must be served and they must be denied bail,” he said. The matter was adjourned to October.
