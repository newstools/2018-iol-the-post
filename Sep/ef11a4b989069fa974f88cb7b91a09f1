Durban -  The KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Mxolisi Kaunda has vowed to strengthen the partnership between the police, and the community to ensure that crime is reduced drastically in the province. Kaunda was reacting to crime statistics released by the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, on Tuesday, which indicated an increase in all forms of crime in the country, with 57 people murdered daily. KwaZulu-Natal is one of the provinces which reported the high rate of murders during the 2017/18 financial year. Other forms of crime which increased sharply include cash in transit heist, violence against women and children and stock theft. Firearms have been identified as the common weapon used in the commission of the crimes. Kaunda has committed the provincial government to work closely with the Minister to collectively deal with the scourge of crime. “These crime statistics are a call to all of us that we must declare a war on crime wherever we are. We must spare no effort in ensuring that our community crime-fighting structures which include the Community Policing Forum and KwaZulu-Natal Community Crime Prevention Association (KZNCCPA) are supported and fully functional,” said Kaunda. He said that while government would intensify the fight against crime, it will also continue to attend to socio-economic challenges affecting various communities which include poverty and unemployment.
