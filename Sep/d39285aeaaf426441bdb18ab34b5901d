This was emphasised by President Cyril Ramaphosa on his visit to KwaZulu-Natal this week after members of the Federation for Radical Economic Transformation (FFRET) stormed the offices of the KwaZulu-Natal health department in Pietermaritzburg and demanded changes to its procurement unit. Ramaphosa said he would not allow forums masquerading as radical economic transformation advocates to use ANC policies to achieve their “terrible ends of theft, robbery and malpractice”. The federation is known for disrupting government and private construction sites and demanding a portion of work be given to its members, while claiming to be implementing radical economic transformation. Radical economic transformation was adopted as a policy at the ANC’s December conference. While introducing Ramaphosa, in Chatsworth last week, Economic Development MEC Sihle Zikalala said disruptions were among the problems the province was facing. The provincial government was committed to exposing those invading government offices because their conduct was criminal, he said. FFRET president Malusi Zondi said the federation was dismayed by the president’s statement.“We want to ask the president if asking for radical socio-economic transformation and inclusive economy to benefit the majority of our people on the ground means robbery? “How long is our economy going to benefit only the few monopoly capitalists, which are predominantly white,” asked Zondi. The federation praised eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede for “being the only mayor to implement the radical economic transformative policy". SUNDAY TRIBUNE
