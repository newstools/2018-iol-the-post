Durban - Two people who were allegedly robbed while having sex in a car in a sugar cane field in Cottonlands, Verulam, on September 13, were charged for defeating the ends of justice after they reported false cases to police. KwaZulu Natal police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said one the day of the incident, the 47-year-old woman, opened a case of rape and a few days later the man, aged 42, opened a case of hijacking. "The woman reported that she was raped on September 13 at Cottonlands in Verulam. "The case was reported to police a day after the incident and detectives took over the docket. "Four days later the man then alleged that he was hijacked by two suspects on Old Main Road in Tongaat also on September 13. The case was opened at Tongaat police station." Zwane said Tongaat detectives were able to link these cases to reports on social media by a local security company who described in detail how the man and woman were robbed while engaging in sexual activity at a sugarcane field on the same day. "Both victims were arrested and charged for defeating the ends of justice and will appear in court. Police are again warning members of the community to refrain from reporting false cases as police resources are wasted when police spend time and money investigating these matters." He said police take all reports of crime seriously and those that open false cases will be caught out. POST
