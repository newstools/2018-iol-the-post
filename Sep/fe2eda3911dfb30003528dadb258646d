Durban - It has been one week since the body of a young boy was found buried in a shallow grave in Phoenix. Despite speculation that the body belonged to missing boy, Miguel Louw, his family's anguish continues as DNA test results have yet to be released. On Monday, police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, said they were still waiting for DNA results from their forensic team. Following the gruesome find, DNA samples were taken from both Miguel's parents. On Monday afternoon last week, police discovered the remains of a young boy in a shallow grave in dense bushes along Longbury Drive in Phoenix. Due to the clothing on the body, many believed that it was Miguel. The youngster was last seen on July 17 in the company of Mohammed Ebrahim. Video footage later emerged of Ebrahim and Miguel buying food from a KFC in the Sydenham area, not too far from Miguelâ€™s school. Ebrahim, 43, was arrested three days later after Miguel did not return home. He faces a charge of kidnap and theft. Despite being granted bail, Ebrahim's family could not raise the bail amount and he remains behind bars. Daily News
