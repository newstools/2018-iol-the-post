Durban - A 68-year-old man survived being attacked with a hammer during a home invasion on Thursday. According to Prem Balram, director of Reaction Unit SA, two suspects armed with knives and a hammer, attacked the man and his wife at their Redcliffe, Verulam home just after lunch. "One suspect dragged the female victim into the home while his accomplice assaulted her husband on his head with a hammer. The suspects robbed the victims of R250 in cash. They then loaded house items into the victim's car and drove up an unpaved road where they offloaded the stolen goods into their getaway vehicle." Balram said they then returned to the home to allegedly steal more items however the Toyota Corolla switched off and failed to start. "The suspects abandoned the vehicle and fled the scene. An intense search was conducted for the suspects however they still remain at large.The male victim sustained a laceration to his head and was transported privately to a medical facility." The attack comes days after the brutal murder of Dhir 'Roy' Singh, 68, and his partner Kallawathie Beekarie, 60, who were found died in the bathroom of their home in Cottonlands on Monday afternoon. A television set and the couple's car was taken during the robbery. KZN police said they were unaware of the incident. POST
