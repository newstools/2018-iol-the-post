Durban - Beach-goers will have to be extra cautious when visiting beaches along the KwaZulu-Natal coast for the next few weeks. This, according to Sharks Board Operations Head, Mike Anderson-Reade, is because they have had to temporarily reduce the number of protected beaches due to some of their employees going on strike. Last month, employees went on strike with workers demanding an increase in wages. During this time, shark nets were not serviced. At the time, it was reported that the workers are demanding, among other things, a 15% pay increase across the board. Anderson-Read said bathers could use the following beaches: North Coast: Salt Rock Beach, Willards Beach (Ballito Bay main beach), Umhlanga Rocks main beach. Durban: Ushaka to Bay of North Beach inclusive South Coast: Amanzimtoti Main Beach, Scottburgh, St Michaels, Uvongo, Margate Main Beach, Ramsgate, Southbroom, San Lameer. “Visitors to the beaches are requested to check with the lifeguards prior to entering the water,” he said.
