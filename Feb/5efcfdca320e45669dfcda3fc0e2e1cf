Durban - The fencing of bridges regarded as hotspots for rock throwing appears to have been put on the back burner.
Deputy mayor Fawzia Peer said there were several reasons why fencing would not be ideal. “They have the effect of making the pedestrian user claustrophobic or feeling trapped within an enclosed structure and vulnerable to mugging, resulting in people opting to cross the road as an alternative to using the bridge,” Peer told POST. “The fencing material often becomes attractive to those collecting for scrap, needs future replacement and maintenance as well as the possibility of sections suffering vehicular impact damage and falling onto the road below. "As a result, fencing of bridges will be considered only as a last resort option.” Peer said 15 of the 180 bridges under control of the city, KZN Department of Transport or Sanral have been identified as hotspots. She said while there are continuous patrols at the bridges, a more permanent solution included awareness campaigns, road shows, bush clearing, lighting up of areas and CCTV camera installation. Peer and her committee are scheduled to meet next Wednesday to again discuss the issue. Speaking about the TST aerial exercise, she said: “Never before have we seen a community so united and energised towards a cause. It speaks well of the strong relations that exist between the city, community heroes and its members and selfless people, who footed the bill for the expensive but essential exercise.” POST
