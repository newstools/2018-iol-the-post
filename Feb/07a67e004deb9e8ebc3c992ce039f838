Durban - Police in KwaZulu-Natal are appealing to home owners not to keep large amounts of jewellery at their homes, after a Pietermaritzburg family was robbed of their jewellery during a home invasion on Tuesday. "It is alleged that three  armed suspects forcefully entered the  home in Orient Heights, Mountain Rise and threatened the owner and his family with firearms. "A large  amount of jewellery was taken from the house before the suspects fled the scene in their getaway vehicle," said police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane. He said police had noticed that there was a number of cases where criminals target houses specifically for jewellery. "An impression is created that these criminals have information beforehand as to which homes have large amounts of jewellery. If you have a lot of jewellery at your homes it is possible that those close to you, including your family, friends or employees might be leaking information to criminals." Zwane said home owners should rather keep their jewellery in safety deposit boxes at facilities that are available for this purpose. "You are putting yourselves and your families at risk by keeping items of extremely high value and large sums of cash at home. "Jewellery store owners are also cautioned to take extra precautions and strengthen their security measures to safeguard their jewellery. Beware of criminals who will pretend to be customers and enter the store with firearms." The robbery is being investigated by the Mountain Rise Police Station. POST
