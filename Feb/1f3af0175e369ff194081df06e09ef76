Durban - Touched by the plight of the community of Cape Town struggling with the water crisis, an oThongathi pupil started a water collection drive. The Grade 7 pupil from Buffelsdale Primary School collected over 400 bottles of 5 litre water, which were donated to the humanitarian aid organisation, the Gift of the Givers. The organisation, which is running Operation Cape Town - Drought Water Crisis, has been encouraging donors, businesses and individuals to spare a thought for residents in the Western Cape. “Water is a basic necessity and life becomes difficult without it. "I cannot imagine what my life would be if I was in the same situation and knew I had to do something to help,” said Alka Runglall. The 12-year-old of Watsonia designed and printed over 100 pamphlets, which were distributed to schools and within the community to assist with the drive. “My parents and grandparents helped me distribute the pamphlets with the drop off point being at my school.” Her dad Vishaal, 44, a teacher, and mom, Sheena, 42, a salon owner, said they were proud of her. “We are glad she is taking this initiative to help those in need,” said her mom. Alka handed over the water, but if you would like to assist in this ongoing initiative, 5 litre bottles of water can be dropped off at her school during the week from 7.30am to 2pm. POST
