IF YOU are someone who hardly gets sound sleep, then now is the time to add smart options to your sleeping habits. Ankit Garg, co-founder and chief executive of Wakefit and Devrath Vijay, founder of the Functional Training Studio - The Outfit suggest some smart options to add to your lifestyle for a wonderful sleep. * Anti-snoring products: From tongue stabilising devices to nasal pathway cleaners, anti-snoring products are popular tools allowing people to have a restful sleep. * Memory foam mattresses: Arguably the most popular sleep enabling products, these mattresses provide hours of blissful sleep. They enable deep sleep by providing optimal spine support. * Mint-flavoured throat sprays: Containing a time-release formula which coats the back of the throat, reducing the vibrations of the soft tissues that cause snoring. * Noise reducers: By curbing the ambient noise to create a calm, relaxed surrounding, noise reducers help people - sensitive to even the slightest of noises - to sleep. * Sleep masks: Sleep masks help people who find it difficult to close their eyes and doze off. * Herbal pillows: Filled with organic flaxseeds and aromatic herbs, these pillows provide a gentle, soothing heat and calming aroma. - POST
