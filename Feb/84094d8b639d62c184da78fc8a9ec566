Letter - Every February, the media goes into overdrive promoting love and affection in the form of Valentine’s Day. Valentine’s Day, like other events that are hyped up by the media, are money making tools, clever marketing that manipulates your emotions to get into your wallet. Yet with all this supposed romance in the air, statistics show that instead of Valentine’s Day being a day of love, there are more break-ups and divorces at this time all over than at any time of the year. The media thrives on peddling fantasies as reality and if we buy into their hype, we tend to feel quite bitter when these fantasies do not materialise. For the many whose Valentines and fantasies are not realised or who do not receive a Valentine’s card or gift, this period can be one of the most depressing times in the year and this does not affect adults only. Children at school are more affected by their relatively fragile emotions. We need to take a hard look at our lives and see the direction we are heading in, and the challenges that face our children. Take notice of your own feelings and special notice of your children on February 14, and gauge the effect this has in our lives. POST
