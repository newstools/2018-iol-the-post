Letter - During the ANCâ€™s elective congress in December, when Cyril Ramaphosa was announced as the new leader of the party, my wife burst into tears - tears of joy I must add. She was simply overjoyed that Ramaphosa had won. Overjoyed, because she feels we now have a president, who will hopefully govern our country with integrity. The following is her reasons why she believes that Ramaphosa will make a good president. He has an infectious personality that makes you want to listen to him when he speaks. He is a billionaire and will not steal from state coffers. He has promised clean and corruption free governance and strongly believes in the ideals and values of Nelson Mandela. As a successful businessman, he will be able to entice investments which our country badly needs. He has already told the world that South Africa is now open for business. He will create jobs and grow the economy and will scrap the ill-advised, unaffordable and unnecessary nuclear deal. He will stop the state capture of state owned enterprises, and fire boards and executives who are captured. He has already fired the Eskom board members and corruption accused executives, Anoj Singh and Matshela Koko, and put in place new board members with impeccable records. It shows that Ramaphosa is serious about fighting corruption. My wife will be voting for the ANC in 2019. She is pretty confident that a large majority of Indians will be doing the same. POST
