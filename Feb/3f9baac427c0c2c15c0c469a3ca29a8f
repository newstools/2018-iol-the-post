Letter - I cannot begin to convey the depth of my despair at hearing of sales negotiations of a most beloved institution. I have been made aware of the article printed on the matter. However, the reasons given by the current administration seem highly equivocal. Falling numbers for temple activities: The admin has conveniently failed to mention the fact that these activities were thriving and devotees were coming in their numbers to display their devotion. The reason for the current decline is due to the restrictions placed by said administration, making it nearly impossible for devotees to participate. Upon further investigation, it could be found that the temple board meetings have been monopolised by the same committee members intent on selling the temple. The standard of the weekly service has dropped drastically due to changes incorporated by the admin who, might I add, do not attend the service themselves. Finances: It seems highly unlikely that the organisation is lacking funds for upkeep, as the sale of religious books, fund-raiser activities as well as donations from the devotees has been the only place where the admin has shown their presence. Are they still saying funds are insufficient? If so, why is so much money being wasted on book launches and workshops? It is high time these issues be brought in front of the public. The solution to these problems is not the sale of the mandir, but rather a change in management to people who are actively involved in the temple and are not just using the name of the organisation to gain appraisal in the public eye. I look forward to seeing some action taken by the public to stop this injustice. POST
