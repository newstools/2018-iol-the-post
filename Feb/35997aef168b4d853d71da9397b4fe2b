Durban - Raising hopes for a cancer vaccine for different types of cancers, researchers have found that injecting minute amounts of two immune-stimulating agents directly into solid tumours in mice can eliminate all traces of cancer in the animals. A clinical trial was launched in January to test the effect of the treatment in humans with lymphoma, cancer of the lymphatic system. The approach works for many different types of cancers, including those that arise spontaneously, said the study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine. The researchers believe the local application of very small amounts of the agents could serve as a rapid and relatively inexpensive cancer therapy that is unlikely to cause the adverse side effects often seen with bodywide immune stimulation. "When we use these two agents together, we see the elimination of tumours all over the body," said senior author of the study Ronald Levy, Professor at Stanford University School of Medicine in the US. "This approach bypasses the need to identify tumour-specific immune targets and doesn't require wholesale activation of the immune system or customisation of a patient's immune cells," Levy said. "Our approach uses a one-time application of very small amounts of two agents to stimulate the immune cells only within the tumour itself. In the mice, we saw amazing, bodywide effects, including the elimination of tumours all over the animal," Levy explained. POST
