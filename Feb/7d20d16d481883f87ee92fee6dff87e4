The bullet, however, could not be removed as doctors feared it would result in further damage. The uncle, who declined to be named, said the Grade 5 pupil was in a stable condition. “We are not certain how the bullet will affect him. We are waiting on doctors to determine the next step.” Relating what had happened, the man said: “My wife and three daughters were alone at home. Five men came to my front gate and via the intercom claimed they were fumigators. "My daughter, who spoke to them, opened our driveway gate by remote and allowed them onto our property.” When she went outside, she realised they were not fumigators. They arrived in an unmarked vehicle, wore casual clothing and had no identification. “My daughter ran into the house and locked the front door. She told her sisters and mother what was happening and they locked themselves in a bedroom. The men broke down our door and also tried to break down the bedroom door.” His wife and daughters, he said, did not have their cellphones and could not call for help. “My parents, who live next door with my nephew and his parents, heard their screams. Our domestic worker, who was at my parents’ home, contacted me and told me what was
happening. I called the police.” During this time, he said the men began grabbing all the values they could find, including electronic equipment. “Before they could flee in their vehicle, they saw my relatives running out to confront them and fired three shots into the air to deter them. A stray bullet struck my nephew, who was on the balcony.” The man’s wife and daughters are undergoing
counselling. The director of Task Force Security, Roshin Ramnarain, said: “Criminals are pretending to be municipal workers or looking for jobs. It’s becoming a problem. We therefore encourage residents to be vigilant.” Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a case of house robbery and attempted murder was being investigated. POST
