Durban - Two cousins, who have been described as inseparable by their families, were killed within minutes of each other in two separate hit-and-run accidents at the Trade Centre off-ramp in Phoenix on Sunday morning. Bradley Chetty, 24, a supervisor, and his younger cousin, Nigel Arguna, 17, a Grade 11 pupil at Northmead Secondary School, were walking to their homes in Whetstone, Phoenix, after spending the evening at the Gateway Theatre of Shopping in uMhlanga. Arguna’s dad, Rio, said a relative had dropped off his son, Chetty and a friend at Gateway on Sunday afternoon. “I allowed Nigel to go out because I knew Bradley would take care of him,” said Rio. “They were walking home during the early hours of the morning when Nigel was hit by a vehicle. His skull was cracked and he broke his neck. "Bradley and the friend became frantic and tried to flag down passing motorists for help but Bradley was also hit by another vehicle. Both drivers did not stop to help but fled.” Rio said the friend contacted the family and paramedics for help. “My wife, daughter and I rushed to the scene only to find Nigel’s badly injured body wrapped in foil. Bradley was taken to the Mahatma Gandhi Hospital where he later died. He sustained a number of broken bones.” The father of four described both young men as inseparable. “They did everything together. Nigel regarded Bradley as his big brother and looked up to him.” Their funerals were on Monday. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of culpable homicide was being investigated. POST
