Durban - Another seven months behind bars. That’s how long former SAA flight attendant Priya “Pree” Govender, who is accused of drug trafficking, will have to wait before she is expected to stand trial in Australia in August. The 32-year-old former Phoenix resident pleaded not guilty to charges of importing a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug when she appeared in the Supreme Court of Western Australia on Monday. Govender was arrested by Australian Border Force officers at Perth Airport in August 2017 after 6kg of cocaine was found in her luggage. Since her arrest, her family has declined to comment. The court manager, media and public liaison, Val Buchanan, said Govender would be remanded at the Melaleuca Remand and Reintegration Facility, a maximum security prison for women in Western Australia. “Ms Govender was remanded in custody to a status conference on March 22. The status conference is simply to ensure the progress of the matter. It is largely procedural, ensuring the matter is going to be ready to go to trial. A trial date has been set for August 22.” Govender has worked for SAA since January 2010. The airline’s head of department of media relations, Tlali Tlali, said the matter was now being handled by Australian authorities. POST
