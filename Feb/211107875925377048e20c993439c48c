Durban - Hindu priest Niren Chetty, 30, of Phoenix, believes speaking in one’s mother tongue gives one an identity. “Each person should be proud to speak in his or her mother tongue as each language has its own beauty,” said Chetty. “We should not rob ourselves of our roots and culture. "Whatever little we know, we should keep it alive and be proud.” Chetty attended Tamil classes from the age of 12 and can speak both English and Tamil fluently. “I first attended a Tamil school named HYMA and when I was 17, Suriya Kumari, of Pietermaritzburg, offered me private lessons and I learnt to read and write in the language.” At 21, he left for India to study to become a priest. “I had a difficult time with the language while in India because I lived in a village where only Tamil was spoken. "I could read Tamil and understand it, but I could not converse with them because they have a different way off pronouncing the words. It took me time to learn the language but I managed.” Chetty explained that spoken Tamil was different to the written version. “I could only understand the written Tamil because I learnt that here in SA. But luckily the locals there helped me out.” Chetty said the youth should be encouraged to learn their mother tongue and that he was contemplating studying isiZulu. POST
