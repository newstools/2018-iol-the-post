Durban - After a short stay at home, the 9-year-old boy who was struck in the stomach by a stray bullet during a robbery at his uncle’s home in La Mercy, is back in hospital after falling ill on Monday evening. The Grade 5 pupil was discharged from hospital on Friday and, according to his uncle, he took a turn for the worse. The bullet was not removed from his stomach because doctors feared it would result in further damage. His uncle, who requested their names be withheld, said his nephew was vomiting and was re-admitted. “The robbery shocked our family. We were at ease when my nephew was discharged. "He did complain about discomfort in his tummy, but other than that he was fine.” The robbers, pretending to be fumigators, gained entry into the uncle’s house and took valuables, while his wife and three daughters hid in a bedroom and screamed for help. As the suspects were leaving, they fired three shots into the air and a stray bullet struck the boy, who was standing on the adjacent property. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a case of house robbery and attempted murder was being investigated but no arrests had been made. POST
