Elaine Pillay succumbed to her wounds recently. Her daughter, Christene, 25, a prison warder, died earlier, on December 8, when she was shot twice in the back. The man she had once loved, security guard Shiraz Ismail, 23, then took his own life.

Apparently unwilling to accept that Christene was going to marry another man, police constable Bradley Moonsamy, 25, later that month, he went on a shooting rampage. Dressed in his security uniform, Ismail approached the home and opened fire, shooting Elaine in the neck before turning his aim to Christene. He also shot the security guard before killing himself. Christene died at the scene while her mother was rushed to hospital. Elaine spent two months fighting for her life in ICU. Her family, still grappling with the multiple tragedies, declined to comment. In a previous interview with the POST, Moonsamy’s father, Silvanus, said Christene had dated Ismail previously but had broken up with him because he was “possessive”. At the time of the incident, Ismail’s mother, Shakoon, denied that her son was violent, saying he also did not take drugs or alcohol. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thunlani Zwane confirmed Elaine’s death. POST
