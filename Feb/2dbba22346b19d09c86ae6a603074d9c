Letter - The concern for our planet has grown, especially with regards to the tons of waste we produce that adds to burgeoning landfill sites on a daily basis. We are becoming more familiar with the concept of recycling and this on its own has become an industry that's growing rapidly. Supermarkets use more recycled material in their plastic bags and encourage re-use of bags. This is notable. However, many supermarkets have embarked on a counter productive exercise by introducing trolley wipes. These chemically soaked swabs are really unnecessary. Shoppers have been using trolleys for umpteen years with no related health risks, so why the needless introduction of trolley wipes? This germophobe obsession, that is constantly being promoted, is nothing but a marketing gimmick. We grew up in a world that was by no means sterile but we seemed to have survived pretty well. I say rather spend time on more meaningful activities than this frivolous obsession that's doing more harm than good to our planet. I appeal to supermarkets to refrain from this practice of supplying trolley wipes. POST
