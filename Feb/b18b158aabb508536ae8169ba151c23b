Durban - Taxi cabs and their drivers have been falling victim to carjacking and robbery, KZN police said today. "The drivers are called to pick up a customer and then perhaps shortly requested by the same customer, to pick up another friend along the way to the original destination. "Once the other passenger is picked up, a firearm is produced and the taxi driver is hijacked and robbed of his earnings and personal belongings," said Captain C Rhynes. Rhynes said these incidents were taking place in eThekwini Outer South Cluster, especially in Umlazi Township and surrounding areas, "In most cases their taxi earnings are taken and their personal valuables such as cellphones. "Taxi cabs, especially Uber and Taxify, have become targets of these crimes. On some occasions the taxi vehicle is taken and the driver kidnapped. He is eventually dropped off in an area unknown to him," said Rhynes. The eThekwini Outer South SAPS expressed concern. "SAPS are wanting to work with the Uber and Taxify drivers to help prevent them from becoming victims of such crimes. " eThekwini Outer South Cluster SAPS, appeals to all Taxify drivers to call the eThekwini Outer South Cluster Police OCC office at 031 325 5530 at any time and give their contact details to ensure they get invited to the next meeting by the SAPS.
