Letter - Much publicity surrounds South Africa’s slow growing economy and high unemployment. While political influence has a direct impact on the economy and our quality of life, we need to realign our thinking and start developing skills in our children to ensure that, despite macro-economic difficulties, they are capable of building their futures. Frightening statistics, such as 55% of the South African youth are unemployed, need to galvanise us to ensure our children become employers and not employees. My nephew is in Grade 12 and even before he finishes school, the possibility of him furthering his studies or becoming employed next year looks bleak. Being the eldest grandchild, we as a family have decided to develop his entrepreneurial skills for him to become self-employed and ensure his future has a fighting chance immediately after finishing school. After much research we have found a programme called Teens in Business, which uses a practical approach in teaching teenagers how to develop a customised business plan through videos, stories, business cases and mentors. What we’ve realised is that while we started way too late, the same company has a “kids in business” programme starting with children from seven years old. The participants of the programme also participate in a Children’s Business Fair, which provides practical experience while they build their skills. Our choice is for our nephew not to become a statistic of unemployment but to ensure we give him a fighting chance. With sacrifice we are choosing to give him a fighting choice. Let’s build bridges for our youth with the stones we receive from government. POST
