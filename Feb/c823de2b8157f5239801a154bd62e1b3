Durban- Two siblings, who were allegedly turned away by three schools due to their impoverished backgrounds, are loving every minute of being back in the thick of things. “I cannot wait to go to school everyday. I like my teacher as she is kind. I also like English, Afrikaans, isiZulu and maths, and we get a lot of homework,” said the Grade 2 little girl. “I already have four friends and we play games during our break,” added the 10-year-old.

POST had reported on their parents' plight to get them enrolled into school after they were allegedly labelled "troublemakers" and called "poor and dirty". Earlier this month, a weight was lifted off their dad's shoulders when a Chatsworth school agreed to admit them.

Dozens of POST readers, activists and business owners read about their plight and reached out to them. Durban attorney Azgar Ally Khan, his business associates and friends had managed to secure the children a place at a local school and provided them with uniforms, bags, shoes, stationery and meals. The dad, who is still looking for a job, said he was overwhelmed by the support. “We never expected so many people to help us, but we thank God for those who have stepped in.” POST
