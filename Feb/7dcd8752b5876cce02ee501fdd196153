Durban - Former beauty queen Lisanne Lazarus, pictured, is hoping to win her share of R1million in the Tropika Island of Treasure contest. The 22-year-old, of Amanzimtoti, a digital producer at East Coast Radio, is determined to excel in the eighth season of the reality competition television series, which is broadcast on SABC 3 on Mondays at 7.30pm. Seven "ordinary" South Africans are teamed up with seven celebrities, and undergo a series of challenges in a bid not to get eliminated and to stand a chance of winning a share of the million. Among the celebrities are former Miss South Africa Melinda Bam, and radio DJ Tumi Voster. The series, which is filmed in the Maldives, will end in April. Lazarus, who will graduate with a diploma in Journalism from the Durban University of Technology in April, entered the competition by chance. “Last October, auditions for the treasure contest were held at the Gateway Theatre of Shopping where I was employed in the marketing department. "I was putting together videos for the centre's social media pages, when my manager suggested I enter. I dismissed the idea, but she then entered me,” said Lazarus. While busy filming the videos, Lazarus had not realised she missed her audition. “The officials allowed me a second chance, and I went through three interviews, and within two weeks I was told I was accepted to participate in the competition.” While she cannot divulge too much about the competition, she described the experience as “incredible”. “If I win, I will donate a portion of the R500 000 to my charity, the Lindokuhle Crèche which is located in an informal settlement in Isipingo and the rest will be invested in property.” Lazarus was previously crowned Miss eThekwini in 2014, and in the same year, was "Most Poised Model" in the Miss India SA pageant.
