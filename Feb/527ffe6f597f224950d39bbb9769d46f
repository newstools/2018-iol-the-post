Feature: Choosing to take the back seat in the planning of her traditional Hindu wedding, 28-year-old Johannesburg accountant Merisha Debipersad left everything in the capable hands of her fiancé and family. Formerly from Durban, Debipersad tied the knot with her husband, Vikesh Muggan, last November at the Kempton Park Civic Centre in front of 480 guests. Her wedding colours were gold and white with vintage bird cages, and long-stemmed white roses as centre pieces. Each guest was greeted with a chocolate truffle on a gold encrusted napkin. Although she was not involved in the day-to-day planning; air-conditioning and ample space for her guests to feel comfortable was her priority. “I didn’t do much planning. I handed everything over to my mom, sister and future mom-in-law and a very involved husband-to-be. “The décor was however my final decision, as well as my outfit. “These two very important parts were the only things I thought I needed control over.” Debipersad, who chose not to disclose the cost of her wedding, saying it was a fair amount, said a highlight was having her grandmother present. Asked if she would do anything different, her response was a firm no. “I loved my day from start to end.” The most important moment at her wedding, she added, was the Sindoor ceremony and the exchanging of vows. For couples tying the knot this year, Debipersad said they should not go extravagant on décor. “Buy your flowers directly from the flower markets, plan your honeymoon in advance and try to stick to your budget.” She said the biggest thing to remember was to communicate with your partner. “Understand the other person’s feelings and point of view and make sure you both have no regrets.” POST
