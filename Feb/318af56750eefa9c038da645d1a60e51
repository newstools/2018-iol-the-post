Durban - Washing clothing at least three times a day has become a regular occurrence for Cindy Chetty. “With the sand coming into our homes and onto our clothes, I find myself doing washing about two or three times a day,” said Chetty of Barrackpur Road. “The white shirts, which we hang on the outside washing line, turns brown. Despite the heat, we have no choice but to close doors and windows. "The fan stays on, and as a result, our water and electricity bill has increased over the months by about R800. What other choice is there? We cannot live in dirt.” The 53-year-old, who has lived in the area for nine years, said her family once enjoyed dining out under their carport, but not any more. “I cannot cook and leave a pot or container outside even for a second because of the sand. Every time I touch something, I need to wash my hands. "The sand is everywhere and it’s a headache to constantly be cleaning.” Chetty said residents should have acted earlier to prevent the area from turning into a nightmare. “Back then, I don’t think people knew it would be so bad. In the near future, there is going to be more intense work and who knows what we will be subjected to. As a community, we need to unite and find solutions.” She hoped management of the intended logistics park at the Clairwood Racecourse would put the health of residents and well-being before profits. She said: “Years ago, residents had a problem with a chemical company. An agreement was reached and they used to send out people to sanitise our area to ensure we were not affected by harsh chemicals. "The team behind this logistics park needs to take the initiative and at least put sprinklers on the sand banks, so sand does not enter our properties.” POST
