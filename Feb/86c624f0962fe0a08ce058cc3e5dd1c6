Durban - For Merebank resident Kisten Govender, moving was not an option. With the Merebank area developing into a commercial epicentre, the value of his home has depreciated, leaving him with little to start life afresh elsewhere. Govender has lived in Alipore Road for more than 50 years. “It’s quite dusty here. We have to sweep and dust more times than you can imagine. "Before I lie on the couch, I have to dust it first to ensure all the nonsense is out. Before I go out, I have to wash my car, which turns brown overnight. It’s ridiculous but, what’s even worse, who do we complain to?” He said his wife was asthmatic and he has had to take her regularly to the hospital because she started wheezing. “If I had to pack up, where would we go? A real estate agent told me I won’t get a penny more than R500 000 because no one wants to buy here. "Over the years I put my blood, sweat and tears to make a comfortable home for my family and now we are faced with challenges that are difficult to control,” Govender, 73, said. POST
