Durban - Slow down ageing, reduce the risk of heart diseases and diabetes - these are some reasons why it is important to consume antioxidant-rich foods like dark chocolates, nuts, kidney beans, cranberries and tomatoes, suggest experts. Sonia Narang, wellness expert at Oriflame India and Mehar Rajput, nutritionist at Fitpass, share tips: * The reason that antioxidants are often touted as “anti-ageing” compounds is because they help protect from age-related diseases, which are caused in part by free radicals and inflammation. Antioxidants such as alpha lipoic and others found in pine bark and green tea produce valuable anti-inflammatory results by increasing circulation and cell metabolism. * Different antioxidants benefit different parts of the body: beta carotene is beneficial to eye health. Lycopene is beneficial for helping prostate health. Flavonoids are beneficial for heart health. Spirulina has a variety of antioxidants and other substances that are beneficial in boosting immunity. * A diet rich in antioxidants is important to keep the level of ageing low and in maintenance of good health. * Anti-inflammatory effects: antioxidants in your morning tea and coffee may help prevent heart disease. * Prevent diabetes: diabetes is often accompanied by an increase in the formation of free radicals and harmful compounds. Use of antioxidants can reduce the glucose level and complications of diabetes. POST
