Durban - Having no home to go to after her family’s house burnt down a decade ago, a young woman was forced to move to an informal settlement in Malagazi, where she has been trying to rebuild her life. For 28-year-old Abigail Pillay, her husband Adrian, 34, and mother Selvie Moonsamy, 63, living in the informal settlement south of Durban has been a living hell. “When it rain, it pours,” said Abigail, who is unemployed. “Our two bedroom wood and iron house, which we built on a bank, gets flooded and we have to spend days trying to remove the water. The little belongings we own, get damaged,” said Abigail. She said 10 years ago, her family had renewed hope that their lives would return to normal when the government indicated that RDP homes would be built for informal dwellers - but the long wait continued. “Officials visited, and we filled out application forms, but nothing happened. They come around every now and then to conduct surveys and tell us we will get homes, but we have simply lost faith.” She continued: “We cannot live like this anymore but we cannot afford to rent a flat or a house either because it’s expensive. "Even with the little we earn doing casual jobs, we cannot pay rent between R3 000 and R5 000 a month and still put food on the table and pay for electricity. There’s an old saying, ‘the rich get richer, while the poor get poorer’. That’s our situation. “As far as am concerned, the assurances we were given 10 years ago, and continue to get, are lies. Government has given us, and perhaps other people living in these conditions, false hope.” POST
