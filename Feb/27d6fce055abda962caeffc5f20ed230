Durban - Containing a crematorium, an ashram and a chapel, the Cato Manor Indian Cemetery, started by the local Indian folk, was said to have accommodated people of all religious and cultural backgrounds. It was one of the first Indian burial sites in Durban, but operations ceased in the 1970s. Gravesites found, dated back to 90 years. The earliest tombstone discovered was from 1928 and belonged to Roonkan Ramaswamy Naidoo, who travelled with his parents from India to South Africa in the 1860s. His grandson, 77-year-old pensioner Dasarath Naidoo, who was born in Cato Manor, said he hoped funerals would be conducted there again. Dasarath’s nephew, Logan Naidoo, 54, of Newlands West, spoke of his frustration with the destruction of the tombstone, which was constructed of marble. “His tombstone, which had a message engraved by my grandparents, existed until 2013 and was demolished without notification. They had no respect for our ancestors,” said Naidoo. “My great-grandparents built schools in the area and had a road named after them. "They lived at 79 Roonkan Road in Stella Hill, which now houses UKZN’s Howard College campus. "The site was turned into a commercial spot for people to profit from. It is a far cry from anything resembling what it needs to be. It needs to reflect the heritage and the history of the people who lived there, and were buried there.” The tombstone, discovered in 2003, by a group of workers, read: "In memory of our beloved father, Roonkan Ramaswamy Naidoo. Died 15 August 1928 at age 73. Peace. Perfect Peace. Erected by R Balram Naidoo and Bros." POST
