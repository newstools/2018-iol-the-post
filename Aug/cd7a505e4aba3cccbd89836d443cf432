Durban - If you expected to grab your entries to next year’s Comrades Marathon next month, you may just have to wait a little longer. The association announced on Thursday that they their September 1 traditional date and entry process is currently being reviewed. CMA spokesperson, Delaine Cools, said this was in line with their Runners First Initiative and feedback from their athletes. According to CMA race director, Rowyn James, they understand that many Comrades Marathon athletes were looking forward to getting their entries for the race, especially following on the unprecedented response experienced last year. “Last year our entire entry quota sold out within three weeks of opening.  Announcements will be made in due course as to the entry period as well as other exciting developments which are in the pipeline,”James said. CMA Chairperson, Cheryl Winn has requested that Comrades runners bear with the CMA as we fine tune the process and ensure that the entry opening for #Comrades2019 will be well-communicated and as open and fair a process as possible. “Our athletes are our priority and in our quest to put runners first, we are certainly ensuring that next year’s Up Run meets the world class standards that the Comrades Marathon is widely known for,” Winn said. The 2019 Comrades Marathon will be the 94th edition of the world famous ultra-marathon. In keeping with its alternating Up Run and Down Run tradition, next year’s event will be the 48th Up Run in Comrades history and will be held on Sunday, 9 June 2019 finishing at the Scottsville Race Course in Pietermaritzburg.
