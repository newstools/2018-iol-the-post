Durban - Dustin Govender, the man accused of allegedly pouring petrol over his father's employee’s left leg before setting it alight, appeared briefly in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Friday morning. The 28-year-old, dressed in jeans and a grey shirt, appeared before Magistrate Mohamed Motala who extended his bail. “Mr Govender your bail has been extended, investigations have been completed and the matter will go to the senior public prosecutor,” said Motala. While 31-year-old single mother, Zinhle Mchunu was not present in court, she told POST she will attend once the investigating officer asks her to. When POST spoke to Mchunu last month, she mentioned she was still undergoing treatment for her wounds. “I still have a problem to walk. I have to walk with the sticks. With the cold my joints pain even more.” Govender handed himself over to police days after Mchunu reported the incident and was released on R7 000 bail. He faces attempted murder charges. He is expected back in court in September. POST
