DURBAN - TEN medical students from the University of KwaZulu-Natal’s Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine were arrested following protest action at the institution on Thursday. About 200 students blockaded the university entrance on Umbilo Road as the strike entered its second week. Students protested over issues at the university’s Pietermaritzburg residence where some of the students live, as well as the alleged mismanagement of university funds. They are also asking for a report back from university management regarding an investigation into the sale of places at the institution. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said students had intimidated university staff and other students during their protest. “Public Order Police and Umbilo police instructed the students to disperse and they refused. Police were then forced to use water cannons to disperse the unruly crowd. No injuries were reported. Police arrested 10 suspects aged between 18 and 27 for contravening the Gatherings Act,” said Mbele. She said the students would appear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Friday.
