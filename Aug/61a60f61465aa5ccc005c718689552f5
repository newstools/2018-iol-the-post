Mukesh Hardew, 41, a fruit and vegetable supplier, was shot in the shoulder in front of his son during a hijacking along a dirt road near his home in Newark, near KwaDukuza (Stanger). When the suspects, still not caught, were unable to get his car they opened fire on him before fleeing. After Hardew, 42, unemployed, heard of the shooting she ran to her husband’s aid. “I was in the ambulance with him and I watched him die. It was the hardest moment I ever faced. I felt my whole world coming crashing down on me.” Since that fateful day, Hardew’s life has never been the same. She is now caring for her ill father-in-law, Sathinarian, her children Senalia, 17, a matric pupil; Araav, 14, a Grade 9 pupil; and Adiyah, 4. “Every day is a struggle. We are trying to cope and somehow things always seem to work out. I cannot work because I care for my father-in-law but for now I am fortunate I have money saved to care for him and my children.” Hardew said being both a mom and a dad had been her biggest challenge. “My children miss their father so much. I try my best to fill that void but I can still see the the hurt in their eyes. They have been my rock and my strength. They are my reason for living right now and why I put on a brave face every day despite how I feel.” She describes her husband as a gem. “He was everything to us. He took on all our burdens and ensured we had everything. The men who killed him are still at large. I become angry when I think about them. Why kill him, why take him away from us, why didn’t they think about his family?” she asked. Hardew said she had lost faith in the police. “Since March there has been no leads. Even if someone is arrested, we can get some closure, but nothing.” POST
