His grieving family would not say much on Sunday, only indicating that funeral arrangements hadn’t been finalised but he would be buried in his hometown, Port Elizabeth. Police said a death inquest case had been opened for investigation. Meanwhile, the family of another CPUT student, Sinaye Hlanjwa, who went missing for 17 days, said words couldn’t describe the joy and relief they had when she was found on Saturday. The 24-year-old maritime studies student went missing on August 1. Her family had sleepless nights praying for her safe return. She had left a chilling note reading “Start your search in Camps Bay if I am missing for more than 21 days” in her room at the Catsville Residence. Her older sister, Lazola, said that when she called her on the morning of her disappearance, she couldn’t reach her and thought she was in class. “At night I tried to call her again but it went straight to voicemail and even then I assumed she was studying because I knew she had some tests or project; when she studies she switches off her phone. "The next day she didn’t call me back. I called again but her phone went straight to voicemail. That’s when I got worried and called the residence mother (someone in charge of the residence) to check if she was fine,” said Lazola. She said the person in charge had gone to her room and found the note. “She informed me of the disturbing note and we spoke to her friends who said they had also been worried as they couldn’t get hold of her and she had missed classes, something she never does. “At that point I was terrified and went to the residence to try to find more leads. Some students said they saw her carrying a fleece and backpack. It’s like she knew she might be going to an unsafe place,” said Lazola. Cape Times
