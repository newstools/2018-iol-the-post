But Kiran Bhaijnath believes she was spared because God was with her. Bhaijnath, 59, cried while she spoke to POST about her ordeal, describing the experience last week as horrific and traumatising. She said she was thrown onto the bed by one of the assailants. “He pushed me flat on the bed, but I quickly jumped off. He caught me and yanked my gold earrings from my ears. I truly believe that he wanted to rape me but something stopped him, and that could have only been God.” She said the gang ransacked her home in under 30 minutes and left with goods worth more than R100 000. “To my knowledge, these men have taken everything they deemed valuable. From our flat screen TVs, handbags, jewellery to hair straighteners, Eastern wear from India and even scripted medication.” The self-employed sweetmeat maker was alone with her domestic worker when the incident occurred on Thursday morning. “I was busy cutting the tomatoes for my kitchery that was cooking on the stove. The next thing I knew, a guy was behind me and told me to keep quiet.” Four other men walked in, three holding guns and one holding a pick axe. “When I took them to the safe, they kept rushing me to open it quickly or they would kill me.” She and her domestic worker were subsequently pushed into the toilet and a fridge was placed in front of the door to prevent their escape. No arrests have been made. POST
