Durban - A 14-year-old school boy will appear in the Durban Magistrates Court on Friday for allegedly stabbing a pupil from another school in Isipingo earlier this week. The pupil faces a charge of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm after he allegedly stabbed a 17-year-old pupil during an altercation. It is alleged that the school boys, who are from different schools, got into a fight on Tuesday afternoon. Alpha Alarms spokesperson, Seshin Govender, said their officers were alerted to the scene. “It is alleged that a gang of about 20 boys attacked a pupil who sustained stab wounds. The gang then fled when Isipingo Hills Community Policing Forum members and the private security responded,” he said. Govender said the injured 17-year-old was taken to the local police station where he was met by his family. “The younger boy was also taken to the police station. A toy gun was found in the backpack of the pupil who was apprehended. It is alleged that the pupils who fled had an assortment of weapons in their possession,” Govender said. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed they were investigating the matter. He said the older boy sustained stab wounds to his back. “The motive of the attack is unknown at this stage. Isipingo police arrested a 14-year-old suspect and he was charged for assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. He will appear in court on Friday,” Zwane said. Daily News
