World - Muslims all over the world are celebrating Eid-ul-Adha on Wednesday. And while millions of people from around the world are on Hajj Pilgrimage in the Holy Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the festival of sacrifice is being celebrated with much fervour in cities around the world. IANS reported that Muslims in Hyderabad and in other towns of Telangana, and in Andhra Pradesh offered Eid prayers and sacrificed goats or cattle commemorating the great sacrifice of Prophet Ibrahim. And while celebrations were in full swings,  'imams' or priests offered special 'dua' (supplication) for the people of flood-hit Kerala and a collection drive was held for the victims. The day began with Muslims attired in their best, offering Eid prayers. The biggest congregation in Hyderabad was held at the historic Mir Alam Eidgah where Moulana Mohammed Rizwan Qureshi led the prayers. Police made tight security arrangements especially in the communally sensitive old city of Hyderabad to prevent any untoward incident. Special check-posts were set up at different places to prevent illegal transport of cattle. Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, his Andhra Pradesh counterpart N. Chandrababu Naidu and the Governor of the two states E.S.L. Narasimhan, greeted people on Eid. "Bakrid symbolizes sacrifice, absolute devotion to God and compassion for the poor. It also emphasises the principle of sharing. Let this spirit of charity and goodwill towards all be cherished and nourished," said Narasimhan. POST
