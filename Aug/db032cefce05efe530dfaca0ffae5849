Durban - An Umzinto mother, who helped a destitute woman, says the woman turned on her and kidnapped her 2-month-old baby. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the 28-year-old mother had met the woman at a taxi rank on Tuesday. The woman had been wearing only a nightgown at the town, she said. "The woman called her aside and explained that she was the victim of abuse and was destitute with no place to stay. The baby’s mother decided to help the stranger and took her to her home," said Mbele. When they got home, the destitute woman complained of a headache at about 8pm and asked for painkillers from a neighbour and she obliged, leaving the baby with the stranger. "Leaving her baby behind, the mother went to get the painkillers but returned a short while later to find that the woman she took pity on, and her baby-girl had disappeared. The baby’s clinic card, milk formula and feeding bottle were also missing. " Mbele said police were investigating a case of kidnapping and have appealed for information. Anyone with information is urged to contact Detective Warrant Officer Rajesh Maharaj on 039-974 6500 / 6556,  Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or their nearest police station on 10 111. DAILY NEWS
