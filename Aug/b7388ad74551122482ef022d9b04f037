Durban - On Monday morning, Durban courts were busy as 78 drunk driving who were arrested over the long weekend, made their first appearances. Metro police spokesperson Superintendent Glen Ndlovu said the arrests were made during alcohol testing roadblocks, that were conducted by the Durban  Metro Police Specialised Unit and Regional Patrols, across the length and breadth of eThekwini Municipality. “As for major motor vehicle crashes with fatalities, we luckily have none in the reports. It would seem that Sbahle Mpisane, who was involved in a major crash on the morning of Thursday, Women's Day, on the Victoria embankment [Margaret Mncadi], is recovering well and is essentially out of danger now”. KwaZulu-Natal’s roads were also busy especially on Sunday as holiday makers made their way back home to KZN where at the Mooi River toll plaza from 2pm there were at least 2000 vehicles headed north every hour and just under 1000 vehicles headed south at this toll every hour. This is according to the records that the N3 Toll Concession is keeping and are available and updated on their twitter feed every hour. N3TC records show vehicles headed north and south at the Mooi River, Tugel, Wilge and Dehoek plazas. Daily News
