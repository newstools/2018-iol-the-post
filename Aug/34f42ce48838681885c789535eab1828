Durban - Megan Prins will exchange her prison uniform for a hospital gown on Wednesday. The Morningside mother, 34, alleged to have overdosed her son Sloan and thereafter suffocating him in an uMhlanga guest house in June, is on her way to Fort Napier Hospital in Pietermaritzburg, where she expected to undergo a mental assessment. Prins made a brief appearance in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. She faces murder charges. The Sunday Tribune had reported that the mother had attempted to take her own life by slitting her wrists after her son’s death. The owner of the uMhlanga guest house, who did not want to be named, said their family were left traumatised by the incident and had to seek counselling. Prins, a project manager in the medical field, was taken to Fort Napier by the investigating officer. She is an awaiting trial prisoner at Westville Prison. The assessment is expected to be conducted over the next 30 days. The case was adjourned for September 25. DAILY NEWS
