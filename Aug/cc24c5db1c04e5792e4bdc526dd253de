Durban - UNISA has distanced itself from a website that stated that people could study for free at UNISA in 2019. In a statement issued this week, UNISA said the information was not authorised by the university. The website which was not named in the UNISA statement allegedly read ‘Yes, You CAN Study For Free at Unisa in 2019’. Principal and Vice-Chancellor, Professor Mandla Makhanya said the university condemns in the strongest terms possible the purveying of false information about its application and registration processes. “In particular, we are concerned that a disingenuous act such as this preys on unsuspecting people who are yearning for an education, and has the potential to leave them devastated when such empty promises cannot be fulfilled. “We urge everyone to be vigilant online and to rely only on the official website for the most up-to-date and accurate information about Unisa processes. Alternatively, you may contact the university telephonically or visit your nearest Unisa service centre for information,” he said. The university also urges its students and the public at large to be vigilant and aware of social media sites that falsely claim to represent Unisa. Unisa’s application and registration processes are available on the university’s website: www.unisa.ac.za POST
