Durban - Durban bus operator, Tansnat, has suspended bus services in Chesterville after buses were damaged in service delivery protests in the area. He was referring to a recent incident where protesters burnt a municipal bus in Mayville in July. At the time, police said that the bus was empty. A case of public violence was opened. A month before that, a municipal bus was set alight in Cato Manor after shacks were demolished. The city’s acting head of communications, Mandla Nsele, said Tansnat made the decision to suspend their services in the township to prevent the risk of buses being damaged or burned. “The situation is being assessed and buses will be restored once the situation is safe and has returned to normal. The city cannot risk attack on buses with the passengers as they may result to injuries and loss of lives,” Nsele said. He said while the acknowledge residents’ right to protest, they believed that protests should be conducted in a peaceful manner. “The city apologises to commuters for the inconvenience as a result of the bus service disruption. We urge residents to demonstrate civic pride and a sense of ownership of public assets by reporting acts of vandalism to the municipality,” he said. Daily News
