Durban - Police are searching for a gang of five men who held up an elderly couple before ransacking their home on a KwaZulu-Natal farm in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The couple is aged 80 and 88. It is alleged that the men gained access to the couple's home and looted their home and tuck shop. They then fled in the couple's bakkie. KZN police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, confirmed that a case had been opened. Mbhele said the couple had been asleep at their home in home on the Rankin Farm in Glendale at the time. She said the men produced firearms and took an undisclosed amount of money and two firearms. "The men made off in the couple's vehicle," she said. It is believed the couple managed to get to a nearby smallholding and the police were alerted to the robbery. Mbhele said a case of robbery is being investigated and no arrests have been made at this stage. Earlier this year, the KZN farming community was rocked by news that a 71-year old woman had been killed following a horrific attack in oThongathi. Three men, one of them a farm worker, have since been convicted and sentenced to 40 years imprisonment of the murder ofÂ Virathapusharana Govender. The men also faced charges of attempted murder of the farmer, possession of unlicensed firearms and two counts of robbery. Daily News
