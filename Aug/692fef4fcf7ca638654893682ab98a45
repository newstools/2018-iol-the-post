Durban - A Phoenix man who allegedly won R25 000 in Friday night's Powerball was allegedly stabbed by his older brother after he refused to share a portion of his win. According to Prem Balram, director of Reaction Unit South Africa, the incident took place at a home in Trenance Park Drive in Phoenix on Saturday night Said Balram: "Members of Reaction Unit South Africa were called out to the residence after the altercation. Upon arrival, it was established that the victim had won R25 000 in Thursday's Lotto Powerball draw. "The victim's elder brother asked for a share which was declined. An altercation then broke out between the two brothers regarding the money. The elder brother left their home and later returned and stabbed his younger brother in the face and fled the scene." Balram said the injured brother provided Reaction Unit officers with a description of his brother. "Officers patrolled the area and managed to apprehend the suspect and the knife. The family decided to pursue criminal charges after the victim received medical attention," said Balram.
