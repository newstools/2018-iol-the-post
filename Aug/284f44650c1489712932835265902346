Durban - R2 million. That is how much a trip to Brazil and Colombia is set to cost for a delegation from the eThekwini Municipality’s Executive Committee. And the Democratic Alliance is not having any of it. The DA’s Caucus Leader in eThekwini, Nicole Graham, said at an EXCO meeting on Tuesday, DA councillors voted against the trip. “The trip will cost R2 million of Public Transport Network Grant funding. The delegation will consist of two councillors, 33 minibus taxi operators and representatives, 14 bus operators, and five municipal officials,” Graham explained. She said while the DA supports the development of the bus rapid transit system in Durban and recognises the urgent need for an improved public transport system, this should not come at a price tag that could be better used for the delivery of services. Graham said benchmarking and international best practice is an important part of improving the municipality’s own systems, but can easily be learnt without an elaborate overseas trip. “National Treasury guidelines specifically request frugality and for municipalities to cut back on overseas trips and needless expenditure. The eThekwini Transport Authority is increasingly embarking on incredibly expensive and aspirational projects that aren't able to achieve their own targets,” she said. Graham added that a few months ago, the city increased the budget for the Moja Cruise taxi incentive programme to a staggering R 202 million, money that could be better utilised for service delivery.
