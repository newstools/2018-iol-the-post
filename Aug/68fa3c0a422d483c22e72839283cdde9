Durban - A massive billboard, bearing the face of missing Durban youngster Miguel Louw, has been erected on the property of a local guest house, in the hopes that it would lead to the 10-year-old’s safe return. The three-metre long and 12-metre wide billboard can be seen from the N3 freeway, both north and southbound direction, just metres away from Tollgate Bridge. Speaking to the Daily News, The Crescent Guesthouse reservations manager, Faraz Thomas, said they put the billboard up to show support for the Louw family. “The Guesthouse is owned by my brother who lives in the United Kingdom. This was his way of showing support for the community. Miguel is a child from our community and we wanted to give back. His disappearance affects us all,” Thomas said. Miguel’s aunt, Tasneem Omardeen, said they were overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from residents, including the owners of the guesthouse. “It is extremely kind of these people to put up the billboard. I have a feeling that if we can get businesses in the Durban Central Business District to put up similar billboards that it will really help us. Maybe they can even get people to pass on information to local churches, if they do not want to be implicated,” she said. Omardeen said the family is still distraught. “But we serve a mighty God and I believe he is still out there. Whoever has him, please leave him at a church closest to you. Please. He is an innocent child. Please find it in your heart to reunite him with his family. Miguel was allegedly kidnapped on July 17, while walking back from school. A 47-year-old man has appeared in court in connection with the matter. The man, who cannot be named as he faces a charge of human trafficking, has claimed that he had nothing to do with the incident. He is due back in court this week. Daily News
