At the time, he told police he had been hired by a Nigerian national to transport the drugs and he would be paid upon his arrival in Vietnam. According to reports,Coetzee is believed to have travelled from South Africa to Brazil on June 6, 2016 where he was given a black backpack.

Vietnam is very strict on the trafficking of drugs with anyone caught trafficking 100g or more of either heroin or cocaine possibly being sentenced to death. Daily News
