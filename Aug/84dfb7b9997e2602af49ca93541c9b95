Durban - National Book Week will take place from September 3 - 9. Hosted by The South African Book Development Council (SABDC) in association with the Department of Arts and Culture The theme for this year’s event is #OURSTORIES, which is intended to highlight not only the fact that storytelling is deeply ingrained in African culture, but that South Africans can and should be the authors of their own stories. “An interest in reading is often catalysed by a personal experience of storytelling,” said Elitha van der Sandt, chief executive officer of the SABDC. “Story is therefore one of the most important gateways into reading. This is particularly relevant when one considers the fact that 58% of South African households have no leisure reading books. This deficit fuels the widespread problem of grade 4 pupils not being able to read for meaning." She said it is with this in mind that National Book Week features the #READABOOK or #BUYABOOK initiative, which aims to encourage reading amongst South Africans and bring more leisure books into households through an in-store donation platform provided in bookstores. The #BUYABOOK initiative, through the SABDC’s publishing partners, will have select titles available at Exclusive Books, Bargain Books, Bridge Books, Love Books and Ethnikids for only R20 until  September 9. This is all forms part of National Book Week’s aim to get as many books into South African homes. POST
