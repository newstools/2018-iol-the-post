Durban - The KwaZulu Natal MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Mxolisi Kaunda personally visited the family of the RTI officer who was killed on duty on Sunday. Thokozani Cele, 41, was knocked and killed on the N3 freeway near Escourt while performing his duties. On Wednesday MEC Kaunda visited Cele's wife and children at their home in  Steadville near Ladysmith to offer his condolences. Cele was stationed at midday in Estcourt. Department of Transport spokesman, Kwanele Ncalane, "During the operation, a truck failed to stop and knocked him. Cele died instantly and the driver of the truck fled the scene." Ncalane described Cele's death as a great loss to the Department. "The manner in which Cele died was unfortunate as it clearly indicates that the suspect is an irresponsible driver, as he failed to stop."
