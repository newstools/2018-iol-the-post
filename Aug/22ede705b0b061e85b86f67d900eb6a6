Durban -  A 22-year-old man, wanted in connection with the murder of two police officers, is due to make his appearance in the Umbumbulu Magistrate Court on Monday. He was nabbed following a multi-disciplinary (Hawk, Durban Organised Crime, Crime Intelligence and National Intervention units) raid in Wyebank at the weekend. Hawks spokesperson, Captain  Simphiwe Mhlongo, said the man is believed to have been involved in the murder of Warrant Officer Clement Fikani Mkhize earlier this month. “Mkhize was off duty when he was attacked at home in Ezigeni Reserve, Umbumbulu on August 11. The officer was rushed to hospital where he succumbed to his injuries,” Mhlongo said. The 22-year-old is also allegedly linked to the murder of Sergeant Njabulo Linda, who was robbed and later killed in June 2018. Mhlongo said Linda was attacked at Malukazi and his service pistol was also stolen. “Four suspects Siyabonga Mkhize (22) Zwelithini Mkhize (29), Mlungisi Ndlovu (25) and Siyanda Ngcongo (21) were arrested  in July this year and the suspect is expected to join them at the Durban Magistrate’s Court on August 30. All suspects four are still in custody,” Mhlongo said. Daily News
