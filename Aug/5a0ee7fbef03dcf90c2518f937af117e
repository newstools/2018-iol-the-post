Durban - Nguluzana Primary School in Nseleni, on the KZN North Coast, are thrilled with the million rand refurbishment of their ablution facilities. The no-fee school situated between Richard's Bay and Empangeni caters for pupils from impoverished backgrounds. The R1 million ablution refurbishment project was spearheaded by Mhlathuze Water and will be launched on Wednesday. According to Siyabonga Maphumulo, corporate communication manager at Mhlathuze Water, their company was approached by the principal of Nguluzana Primary School for assistance. "The project included the construction of a brand new block of toilets, as well as an overhaul of previously existing toilets," said Maphumulo. He said the school was initially built to accommodate 127 students but now caters for about 1 000 pupils excluding teachers. "This put added strain on the school’s ablution facilities and resulted in nearly all the toilets breaking down due to the increased demand."The school now boasts 30 toilets, urinals, a toilet for disabled learners and separate toilets for boys, girls, and teachers." Commenting on the refurbishment, Mhlathuze Water Chief Executive Officer, Mthokozisi Duze, said: “As an organisation that subscribes to the communal principles of Ubuntu we readily agreed to assist Nguluzana Primary when we were approached to do so by its principal.” Daily News
