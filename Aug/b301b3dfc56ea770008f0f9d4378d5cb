According to a report by security company Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), a fight had broken out when the younger brother declined to share his lottery winnings of R25 000 with his older sibling. “The elder brother left their home and later returned only to stab his younger brother in the face and lip. He then fled the scene,” said Rusa boss Prem Balram. “The victim provided reaction officers with a description of his brother and, while patrolling the area, they apprehended him a few roads away.” He was allegedly found in possession of the knife used in the stabbing. The victim declined to comment, telling POST that they have resolved the issue and since reconciled. However, police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm was being investigated. Naledi Masopha, PR manager at lottery operator Ithuba, said: “As the national lottery operator, we take the safety of our winners seriously. This is why we do not reveal the actual identity of any of our winners. “We advise the winners to be equally discreet with their winnings, and if they do choose to disclose that they have won any money from the lottery, it should only be to people that they absolutely trust and feel safe with.” POST
