Durban - If you were planning to register for the Durban Business Fair taking place next month, hurry up! You only have a few hours left until entries are officially closed. Registration officially closes on August 31. The main Durban Business Fair, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year,  is set to take place at the Durban ICC and Durban Exhibition Centre from September 18 - 24 and is expected to be bigger and better than previous fairs. eThekwini Municipality’s acting head of communications, Mandla Nsele, said the fair intends to equip businesspersons with the appropriate skills to grow and sustain their businesses, through networking and linkages with various business sectors and potential buyers. “This premium exhibition will be headlined by influential business people who will share their expertise on business development and the opportunities available for emerging businesses to tap into the mainstream economy,” he said. Mayor Zandile Gumede added that it was encouraging to see the impact that the fair has had on the development of the small business sector. “There is no doubt that the Fair is one tool that we can use as the City in achieving Radical Economic Transformation,” she said. Registration forms can be collected from the 7th Floor, Embassy Building on Anton Lembede (formerly Smith) Street, or on the City’s website: www.durban.gov.za or Durban Business Fair website: www.dbnbusinessfair.com Alternatively you can visit the Fair’s social media accounts including the Facebook page: @Durban Business Fair; Twitter: @ DBNBusinessFair or Instagram: Durban_Business_Fair.
