Durban - In a bid to speed up emergency response time in the province, the MEC for Health in KwaZulu-Natal will on Tuesday handover 100 brand new ambulances to the different districts within KZN. MEC, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, said for the province’s Emergency Medical Services (EMS), health service delivery in conjunction with primary healthcare and hospital services, form part of the unit’s three core pillars. “Ambulances are therefore basically a crucial mobile emergency clinic whose personnel are trained to resuscitate and/or stabilise a patient using sophisticated techniques, equipment and medical drugs. Therefore the significance of this handover and how it will enhance the department’s ability to respond timeously to emergencies within the province cannot be overemphasised,” Dhlomo said. At the launch, the MEC will also announce the number of ambulances that each district will receive as well as how they will benefit its citizens. In December 2017, Dhlomo unveiled 20 ambulances for the province. Read: PICS: KZN gets 20 new ambulances Daily News
