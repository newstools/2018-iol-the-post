Durban - Presenter Search on 3 winner, Harmony Katulondi said it was God who answered his prayers and feels blessed to have been chosen. Katulondi will be the new face on Top Billing which is screened every Saturday on SABC 3. He is the fifth new additional member to the SABC team. Describing the moment he discovered his win,Katulondi said he was overwhelmed. "It was such a humbling feeling to have God answer your prayers and have you experience the beginning of your dream come true. It was a lot of work, learning, believing and hoping, almost like holding your breath and now I could exhale. It left me feeling so blessed." Earlier this month, the fourth season of Presenter Search on 3 saw six brand new faces joining the SABC 3 family. They initially were looking for 3 people. Stepping into the role, Katulondi said landing his dream job has not sunk in yet. "I think that winning my dream job has not sunk in yet and now that I've stepped into my new role as a presenter on Top Billing and done the first few episodes, I realise that I was right. "This is one of the best jobs in the world. It's been so much fun traveling, meeting such awesome people and getting to have an interview them (which I consider as actually just having a conversation with them on camera), discovering and uncovering their stories. "This, alongside eating good food and doing an activity makes for an incredibly fun time on set. But, at the end of the day, this is job after all. We work really hard to bring you the best of the good life and in order to do that, we have very interesting call times and wrap times. Sometimes we start really early and then end really late but it’s well worth it." POST
