Durban - The Durban south community has been left outraged after the famous bell at Grosvenor Girls’ High School was stolen at the weekend. On their Facebook page, the school said the brass bell formed a huge part of the school’s rich history. The post read; “The School bell was stolen this past weekend any time from 24 August 2018 to 26 August 2018. The bell forms part of our history and many traditions in the school. Grosvenor Girls’ High School was given the big brass bell in 1962, this bell comes from the Ship called ‘The Durban Castle’. This bell has stood the test of time and bullet dents from the war are evident.” The school is hoping that the community will band together and help find the stolen bell - in time for this year’s Grade 12 pupils to rind it for the last time as they end their schooling at the Bluff high school. “... and the new Grade 8 learners for 2019 won’t get a chance to ring the bell when they start their school careers,” the post read. A case of theft has been opened at the Brighton police station. Anyone with information about the bell is urged to contact Brighton SAPS on 031 451 8060 Daily News
