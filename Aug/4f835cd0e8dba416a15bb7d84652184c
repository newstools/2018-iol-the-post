Durban - A Durban dentist and a nurse who are accused of negligently causing the death of a Canadian man appeared briefly in the Pinetown Magistrate's Court on Thursday. The Canadian man had sought help at a drug rehab centre in Westville and died. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Natasha Ramkisson-Kara said the matter was adjourned until September 13 for further investigation. Dentist Anwer Jeewa and nurse Zamangwane Hlongwane face charges of culpable homicide. Jeewa is out on R20 000 bail, while Hlongwane is out on R3 000 bail. In January, The Mercury reported that the 26-year-old Canadian man flew to South Africa to undergo treatment for his drug addiction in November 2017 at Mind's Alive, the rehab facility which is allegedly unlicensed. The Canadian man died two days after checking in at the facility and a post-morterm revealed that he had overdosed on Alprazolam (Xanax). Jeewa, who lives in Sherwood, was arrested by the Hawks. During Jeewa's bail application Lieutenant-Colonel Anton Booysen told the court he believed the Canadian man died as a result of poor screening, an incorrect diagnosis and the wrongful administration of ibogaine.
