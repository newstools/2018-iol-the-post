Durban - The winner of the R145 million Powerball spent a mere R20 on their ticket, Ithuba public relations manager Naledi Masopha told Daily News on Monday. The lucky draw took place on Friday night. The winning numbers were 1, 15, 23, 24, 35 and Powerball 4. "The winner has not made contact with us yet, but judging by the size of the jackpot, we are expecting to hear from the winner anytime from now," said Masopha. She confirmed that the winning ticket was bought at Evander Dienstasie, 1 Rotter Dam Road, Evander, Mpumalanga. "The ticket was bought for R20, and the person selected the numbers on their own," said Masopha. Players have up to 365 days from the day of the draw to claim according to Ithuba website. The last PowerBall jackpot to be won was on June 5, and it was won by two people: one from KZN and one from Eastern Cape. The total jackpot prize was R56,125,998.
