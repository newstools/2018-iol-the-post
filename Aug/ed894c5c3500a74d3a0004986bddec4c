While the motive for the protest is yet to be officially confirmed, it is alleged that students were protesting over a range of issues including safety. Campus security and police responded to the scene. Angry students threw rocks at police. Officers had to use stun grenades to disperse the crowd. Last week Wednesday, lectures were also suspended following violent clashes between police and students. According to Zondo, a group of students began protesting and disrupted lectures. They damaged property and vehicles belonging to the university. A staff member was injured when aÂ  change room and toilet were set alight. The protest was due to issues around amenities at some of the residences, shuttle service timetables and National Student Financial Aid Scheme administration. Daily News
