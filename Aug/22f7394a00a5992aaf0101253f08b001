Durban - Ten eateries in Durban will vy for the top spot of making the best bunny chow in town. The annual Coca Cola Bunny Chow Barometer Competition is set to take place at Blue Lagoon on September 9. The bunny chow is a traditional Durban Indian dish consisting of a curry and unsliced bread. Last year Chetty’s Takeaway in Jacobs, south of Durban walked away with the grand prize. On Wednesday the events management met with the top 10 participants. Some of the eateries participating this year are Swaadisht at the Ridge, The Bunny Bar in Morningside and 5 star take-away in Effingham. Speaking at the event, Coca Cola Beverages South Africa’s KZN events manager, Kas Naidoo said this event is running into its 14th year. “People are excited. We are excited. Over the years people have looked forward to the event and we get over 1 500 people at a time digging into a scrumptious bunny.”  POST
