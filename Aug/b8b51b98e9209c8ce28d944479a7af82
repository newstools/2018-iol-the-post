Durban - President Ramaphosa attended the Biodiversity Economy Innovation and People & Parks Conference held at the weekend.

Projects include farming (crop and livestock), agro-processing facilities such as an abattoir for poultry and red meat; a milling plant, tourism and wood crafting facilities. These projects are funded and support by the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) and the Department of Small Business Development (DSBD). Daily News
