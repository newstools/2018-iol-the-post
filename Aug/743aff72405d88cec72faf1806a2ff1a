Durban - “Criminals are roaming around freely and our government is only seen after these incidents. We would like to see more and visible policing in the province,” this is according to Democratic Alliance leader in KwaZulu-Natal, Zwakele Mncwango. He was reacting to reports that revealed the Durban Central Business District was considered to be one of the most unsafe places in Durban. Earlier this week, the Daily News published an article stating that the findings were revealed following research conducted by the eThekwini Municipality. According to the survey, Municipal Services and Living Conditions Survey 3 Year Trends 2015-16, 2016-17 & 2017-18, the Durban CBD featured consistently in the top three over the past few years. Mncwango said these findings were concerning and that urgent intervention is needed. “As we head to the festive season, and thousands upon thousands of visitors will be heading to the city, the DA calls upon all security agencies including metro police as well as the Safety and Security Department led by Mxolisi Kaunda to urgently increase the number of police patrolling in the city,” he said. Mncwango added that there was a need for a professional and well-resourced police force, which will bring down the high crime levels in the country. “More policing in the province is a must,” he said. Earlier this week, Metro Police head, Commissioner Steve Middleton said Metro was currently on a recruitment drive to recruit about 400 more officers. Middleton was speaking at the municipality’s stakeholder session on crime prevention, held at the City Hall on Monday. He said currently, there were just over 2 500 officers working in shifts. "These recruits will undergo training before they are ready to hit the streets in about six to eight months,” Middleton said. Daily News
