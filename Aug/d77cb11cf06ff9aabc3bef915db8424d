The 31-year-old man appeared in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court on Monday. He faces charges of assault. Sabara Yedhub, 73, who runs a tuckshop from home, said that on Saturday at around 6am her neighbour, 31, arrived at her doorstep in Inanda. “He was wobbling and could not speak properly. I could smell alcohol on him,” Yedhub said. She has known him since he was a child. He asked for two cigarettes on account but she refused. An argument ensued and Yedhub’s partner, Mohammed Rasool, 55, stepped in. “This made my neighbour angry and he picked up a wooden plank with nails and starting hitting Mohammed. When I tried to separate them, my neighbour hit me on the hand and head. “I screamed for help. Other neighbours ran to our aid and he fled.” She sustained a broken wrist and a few stitches to the head. POST
