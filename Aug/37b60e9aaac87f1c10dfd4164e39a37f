Durban - In what was described as "a beautiful death", an oThongathi resident has died while on Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca, Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. Considered one of the holiest nights on the Muslim calendar, Mohammed Khalil Ebrahim, 65, is believed to have died in his sleep shortly after finishing a prayer. World of Travel - the group whom Ebrahim travelled with to Hajj - confirmed his death to The Mercury on Thursday morning. One of the group leaders Moulana Muhammad Vanker announced on Radio Islam this morning: “I inform the listeners on the passing away of a Haji on this amazing journey of Hajj. He was in our group and he had just finished praying and he passed away.” Hajj 2018 took place from Sunday, August 19 and concludes tomorrow, August 24. More than 3500 South African pilgrims visited Mecca this year for Hajj. Hajj is the greatest Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca and which all Muslims are expected to make at least once during their lifetime if they can afford to do so. It is one of the Five Pillars of Islam.
