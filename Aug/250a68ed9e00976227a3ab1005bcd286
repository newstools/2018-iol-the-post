Durban - Three police officers have been arrested and charged after an alleged suspect was tortured to death in Muden, KwaZulu-Natal earlier this month. The officers were arrested by members of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) on charges of murder and assault with grievous bodily harm. Ipid spokesperson, Moses Dlamini, said the three police officers are from Muden detectives and the Greytown Crime Intelligence unit "It is alleged that on August 2, the officers were interrogating three people in relation to a murder case.  The three suspects were detained, tortured and assaulted inside Muden police cells until one of the suspects succumbed to his injuries and died. Then the police orchestrated a plan to dispose of the deceased's body by dumping it in nearby bushes. They did not report the incident to their superiors," he said. Dlamini said the man's family noticed that he had not come back home and reported him missing. "The police told the family that the deceased had been released on the same day after questioning. A family member reported the matter to the Ipid's KZN office.  A task team was formed and it worked around the clock and over the weekend. The team conducted an investigation and arrested three police officers on Sunday. They will appear in the Greytown Magistrates Court on Wednesday. They also face a charge of defeating the ends of justice," Dlamini said. On Monday night, Dlamini said they had received a report that another officer implicated in the crime had committed suicide.
