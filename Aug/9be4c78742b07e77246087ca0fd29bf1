Durban - The Hawks are looking for Durban residents who were victims of the black dollar scam. This week, Hawks officers from the Durban Commercial Crimes Unit arrested a 36-year-old man in Berea after he allegedly scammed a resident out of R31 000 in cash. Hawks spokesperson, Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo, said the accused, Kingo Ngbanda Koto befriended the victim earlier this month. “He contacted the victim and asked to meet him opposite the stadium. Koto informed the victim that there is a flight that is on its way from DRC and it is carrying computers as well as his money. He informed the victim that he needed R5 000 to pay Customs and the victim paid him the money,” Mhlongo said. He said a few days later, Koto contacted the victim and asked to meet him in Durban. “He informed the victim that he needed R26 000 more to release the package from customs. The victim paid him the cash. On Sunday afternoon the suspect allegedly met with the complainant again, this time at the complainant’s office. He had in his possession a box containing a gadget, he then plugged the said gadget into an electrical socket and fed apparent fake bank notes which reportedly turned into what seemed like real banknotes amounting to approximately R1 700,” Mhlongo said. Koto then allegedly told the man that he could make more ‘real’ money by converting the fake notes money but he needed R230 000 more for airtime. “The victim then contacted the police for assistance and Koto was arrested. He appeared in the Durban Specialised Commercial Crime Court on Wednesday and was remanded in custody. He is due back in court, Mhlongo said. The Hawks would like to urge anyone who has fallen victim to this crime to contact Captain Ajith Jaganath on 071 481 2631. Daily News
