That was the clear message at an on-air social cohesion panel discussion with members of the Active Citizens Movement on Lotus FM’s Newsbreak at the SABC studios in Durban recently. The discussion was led by political scientist Dr Lubna Nadvi, director of the International Centre of Nonviolence, Crispin Hemson, and motivational speaker Vukile Masoka. It was hosted by Newsbreak presenter Taresh Harreeparshad and was aimed at allowing ordinary citizens to share what being South African meant to them. “We need to focus on love and not hate. To say that one particular group is responsible for X, Y and Z is not right. Collectively we must come together as citizens and realise the important roles we have to play,” said Nadvi. "Despite the country having achieved a lot, the legacy of apartheid had pulled people apart,"she added. Hemson said the country needed to create a powerful and hopeful narrative that involved citizens talking to each other and taking action against hate and intolerance, while Masoka added that South Africans must be motivated to move forward. University student Zamela Ntuli, who was part of the ­audience, said ignorance held people back. “We should always look for something in someone else that makes us the same and educate ourselves on the things that make us different.” Relating her experience, Gayeshni Singh said in her early twenties she left South Africa for greener pastures but survived abroad for two months. “I was living in a First World country and met a couple from Soweto. I could not contain my excitement when I saw them. At that moment, there was no difference between me and the couple,” said Singh. School principal Roshan Ramdheen said when he watched children playing it gave him hope. “They don’t see race or ­colour. It is the adults that are poisoning the young minds of our children.” POST
