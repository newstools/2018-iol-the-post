The 43-year-old man, whose identity cannot be revealed, appeared in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Monday. The charge against him was changed from kidnapping to that of human trafficking. “I did not do this,” he said from the dock. The man’s father, who attended his son’s second court appearance in support of Miguel’s family, was bombarded with questions by them about the boy. “Where is he?” asked one, while another pleaded with the 67-year-old to “talk to your son”. The father replied: “I don’t know anything. I am so devastated and I have got even more sick after hearing what has happened. I wish I could talk to him (his son) but he doesn’t speak to me. "For years we have a relationship where he doesn’t speak. I ask him where he is going, he says he’s going to mosque. I am very devastated by everything that’s happening.” Miguel, a 9-year-old Rippon Road School pupil, has been missing since July 18, apparently on his way home from school. His distraught mother, Raylene Louw, pleaded with the accused to provide information that could help find him. “Where is my son? Give me my son. Tell me where he is?” she cried. The accused, who allegedly worked with Louw, never turned back to face her. The accused was remanded in custody at the Durban North police station holding cells for further investigation. The case was adjourned until next week. POST
