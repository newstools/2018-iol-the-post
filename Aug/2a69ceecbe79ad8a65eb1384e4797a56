Durban - Durban North police are piecing together the circumstances around an armed robbery at a jewellery shop, where one of the robbers was apparently dressed as a woman and wearing a weave. The robbery took place at Anastasia Jewellers in Chartwell Drive, uMhlanga on Thursday morning.  While details are sketchy, a bystander who was across the road from the shop said after he heard gunshots he saw three people inside the shop. "One of them was a woman with a weave on. The other two got out the shop going to a brown Hyundai accent. The door at that point shut and the one man was trapped inside," he said. He said the woman went back to try open the door for the man. "You could see he was panicking as he tried to pull the door open. The woman opened the door for him and all three got into the vehicle speeding off,‚Äù the man said. Messages also began flooding WhatsApp groups claiming that a woman was seen entering the jewellery store and was followed in by two men. Local businessman, Jacques van der Merwe, said he heard gunshots and ran to see what was happening. "I saw four people getting into a car and it raced off. It happened so quickly," he said.
