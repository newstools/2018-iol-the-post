The men of KZN Treasury ended women's month by saying enough is enough with women  and child abuse. Durban - KZN Provincial Treasury men, joined by their female colleagues, hit the streets of Pietermaritzburg CBD in a march against women and children abuse in general and fight against gender-based violence in particular. KZN Provincial Treasury men joined millions of other South Africans in standing tall and saying not in our name. The country is said to have seen a spike in gender-based violence in recent years. Head of Ministry and Chief Director Ntokozo Maphisa led the march and passed on messages of support from MEC Belinda Scott and Head of Department Simiso Magagula. “The MEC and HoD are very pleased with the initiative we have taken. It is indeed the duty of all men to ensure that wherever they are women are not abused. As KZN Treasury stuff we are also doing our bit to lend a helping hand through the messages we are conveying here today. We say enough is enough with this cancer,” said Maphisa. Members of the Treasury interacted with the community on the streets while distributing pamphlets with useful tips. A candle was also lit at the Carbineers Park outside the City Hall in memory of the victims of violence. A self-defence demonstration offered by Serfontein Correctional Services’ Edna Grobler and Sifiso Xhakaza. “While this is not a training, the demonstration today we empower you and equip you with self-defence skills that will be useful when you find yourself under attack of any form,” said Grobler.
