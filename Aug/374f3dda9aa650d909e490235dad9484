Durban - Barely a day after KwaZulu-Natal’s MEC for Education warned pupils about the dangers of school violence, a 16-year-old boy was stabbed to death during a school fight. The youngster, from a secondary school in Inanda, was allegedly stabbed a number of times by fellow pupils. He was rushed to a hospital near the school where he succumbed to his injuries. At this stage, police have confirmed the incident and said investigators were at the scene to take further statements. On Monday, MEC Mthandeni Dlungwane called out school heads for poor discipline in KZN schools. He was speaking at Masakhaneni High School where two boys were killed during a fight. Grade 10 pupil Mangaliso Mbatha, 18, and Sihle Mngadi, 20, in Grade 11, had allegedly tried to separate pupils fighting over a cellphone when they were stabbed to death. Dlungwane told the concerned gathering that several “painful options” were being considered in a bid to restore stability at the school. These would include expelling defaulting pupils, or even closing the school down, if it proved necessary. Daily News
