Durban - Thousands of pupils benefited from The 60 Minutes Fight Against Drug and Alcohol Abuse Annual School Tour that took has been taking place during the course of this year. The aim of the tour, hosted by an organisation called 60 minutes, is to address the negative impact of drug abuse and how it has the power to derail or end one’s future. The various schools visited included KwaHluzinqondo High, Esizibeni High, Umzinto Secondary, Queensburgh Girls High, Mowat Park Girls High and Crawford College. The presentation included past experiences of recovering addicts who shared their stories in an attempt to enlighten the viewers about the reality of addiction and possibly curb any experimentation with addictive substances. The event was all the more powerful as pupils at some schools came forward to ask for help and advice was readily offered by well-trained parties and members who have been down the road of addiction and up the road of recovery. Managing Director of Lightness Productions, Brighton Hlatswayo thanked all those that supported the tour. “The tour was exciting, educational, rewarding and a productive event. “The support we received showed selflessness and a willingness to contribute to the building of a brighter future for our youth short of the impediments that substance abuse has on one’s life,” he said.
