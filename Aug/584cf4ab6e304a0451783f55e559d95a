Durban - The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) has called for full disclosure by Co-operative Governance MEC, Nomusa Dube-Ncube. The party believes that Dube-Ncube must release the long-awaited investigative report into R35 million irregular expenditure incurred at the former Ezinqoleni Municipality. IFP KZN provincial spokesperson on COGTA, Princess Phumzile Buthelezi said the investigation into the Ezinqoleni Municipality's finances were first initiated in August 2017 from reports that Ray Nkonyeni Municipality (RNM) had lost R35 million to irregular expenditure through alleged acts of misconduct by senior managers during the merger of Ezinqoleni Municipality and the Hibiscus Coast Municipality. “It is alleged that just before the merger of the Ezinqoleni and Hibiscus Coast municipalities, a number of construction projects including the construction of a community hall, an access road and a sports field were approved and paid for, but they do not exist,” Buthelezi said. She added that it was concerning that months have passed and still, the report has not been released, nor has the MEC taken any action in light of the allegations. “The MEC has a duty to operate with the highest ethical standards, and with levels of transparency, accountability and good governance expected from a custodian of all municipalities in the province,” Buthelezi said. She added that without the disclosure of the full report, the MEC risks not just further damage to her leadership credibility. “Action must be taken against officials who may have defrauded the municipality. There can be no further delays in this matter. Even RNM councillors have raised their frustrations with the delays after COGTA officials did not show up to present the findings at the council meeting as previously promised. This report must be released as it is in the interest of the public,” Buthelezi said. Daily News
