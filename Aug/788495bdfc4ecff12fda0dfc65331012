DURBAN - PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has again postponed a visit to Chatsworth after failing to arrive in the Durban suburb last month. Ramaphosa had been due to visit Chatsowrth’s Nelson Mandela Youth Centre in July, but got delayed during an event in Empangeni and postponed the event. The events were organised by the ANC under the banner of #ThumaMina. At the Chatsworth event, Ramaphosa had been highly anticipated as residents braved the cold weather waiting for him. However, the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal said Ramaphosa had to postpone the Chatsworth visit due to a tight schedule.  ANC KZN spokesperson Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu said the mooted visit for mid-August would not be possible for the president.  “The Provincial Secretary's office has been in constant communication with Luthuli House to firm up a date. Regrettably, the president's hectic schedule including state responsibilities associated with the recent BRICS summit have meant that he was further unable to travel to the province. The ANC is very pleased with the interest from the Chatsworth community in engaging with the president,” said Simelane-Zulu.  “We are encouraged by the keen interest in the Thuma Mina campaign roll-out in Chatsworth and trust that when the President finally joins us he will also be able to participate in the campaigns underway,” she said.
