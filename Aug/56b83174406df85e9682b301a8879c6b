Durban - Close to 40 000 people have been affected by Dengue fever in Sri Lanka in 2018, with the deadly virus claiming the life of 41 people. Sri Lankan authorities said on July 6 221 cases of infected were reported. That number dropped to 1 075 for the month of August,  Xinhua news agency reported. Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus. People were urged to seek immediate medical attention if they suffered from high fever, uncontrolled vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness. According to Sri Lankan authorities, the highest number of dengue cases this year was 6,937 reported from the capital Colombo. The second highest number of 4,156 was reported from the eastern district of Batticaloa. The third highest number of 3,619 was reported from Gampaha, on the outskirts of Colombo. Dinesh Naidoo, CEO of Serendipity Tours in Durban, said this had not affected travel from South Africa to the popular destination. "Travel times to Sri Lanka generally increased from October to March." He encouraged travelers to take the necessary injections and mosquito repellents. The National Dengue Control Unit last month warned there was an increase in the number of patients this year due to the active southwest monsoon rains. As a result, the National Dengue Control Unit said it had launched special programmes to eradicate dengue breeding grounds in several districts, including the north and east, which were identified as the most vulnerable districts. Over 300 people were killed and more than 136,000 infected by the dengue epidemic last year in one of the country's worst ever outbreaks of the disease in recent years. DAILY NEWS
