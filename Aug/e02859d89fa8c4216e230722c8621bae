Durban -  President Cyril Ramaphosa has extended his warmest wishes to the Muslim community in South Africa and around the world on the celebration of Eid-ul-Adha on Wednesday. According to the Presidency more than 2 500 Muslims from South Africa have travelled to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to join an estimated two million Muslims from around the world for the Hajj pilgrimage. Eid-ul-Adha commemorates Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael in obedience to God, and coincides with the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. This Eid and pilgrimage is about sacrifice, compassion and remembrance that equality is the cornerstone of Islam. The President wishes pilgrims well in their prayers and sacrifices and wishes them a safe return. The holy season of Hajj is commemorated from August 19 until August 24. And while many South Africas have realised their dreams of going Hajj, POST reported that more than 20000 South Africans remain on the waiting list due to strict Hajj quotas. POST
