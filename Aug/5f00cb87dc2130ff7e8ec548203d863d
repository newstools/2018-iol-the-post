Durban - A 52-year-old KwaMashu man who shot dead a woman, he believed stole his cellphone, was found guilty of murder in the Ntuzuma Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. Mseshi Thulani Cele, 52, an operations manager, pleaded not guilty to the murder of Nosipho Nduli, 35, on February 14, 2017. Cele had given the woman who lived in his area a lift. Shortly after, he realised his Samsung cellphone had been missing. When he failed to find the phone, Cele, together with his niece, went in search of the woman. They found the woman in Ntombela Road, KwaMashu. She had been in the company of a few boys. Cele had apparently fired a warning shot using his firearm. This caused the boys and Nduli to also run away. While fleeing the court heard that Nduli fell and Cele shot her once in the back of the head. According to the niece who was the key state witness, led by Prosecutor Kaystree Ramsamujh, he bundled Nduli into his car and drove her to the nearest clinic. She died at the clinic while receiving medical treatment. The witness told the court that her uncle told her to lie to police and tell them that he came under the attack by the group of boys, and had no choice but to open fire on them. Sentencing is expected in October. DAILY NEWS
