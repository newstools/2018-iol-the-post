World - An Indian national, living and working in Canada,Â claims he was a victim of a racial tirade by a woman over a parking dispute. Rahul Kumar, an HR professional, who moved from India to Canada seven years ago, claims the woman told him to "go back to your country" and called him "Paki with sh*t-coloured skin". According to IANS the woman, who identified herself as Angelique, did not deny making the statement, which Kumar filmed on his cellphone. "I can live with myself... I have no problem looking in the mirror ... I love myself. I have no problem with what happened," CTV reported. At one point, she mocked Kumar's accent and said: "F***ing East Indian Paki bulls**t... Go back to your f***ing country, man." Then she can be seen driving off, but not before spitting on Kumar's car and calling him a "loser". After the video went on air, the woman called CTV Edmonton and criticized the coverage, saying that she was "not a racist". Asked whether the parking disagreement justified the racist language used, the unapologetic woman said: "It doesn't matter if it justifies it or not. It happened and that's where I took it and I'm responsible for that." Kumar said he was stunned by the woman's profanity-laden rant and called it disturbing. "I've never experienced anything like that," he said. DAILY NEWS
