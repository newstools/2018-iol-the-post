Durban - The sister of slain MUT student Zolile Khumalo says the #TheTotalShutdown against women and children abuse in Durban on Wednesday, was personal for her, as she knows all too well how deadly gender based violence can be.  Senamile Khumalo is the last surviving of eight children after her younger sister Zolile was gunned down by her ex boyfriend Thabani Mzolo at her Mangosuthu University of Technology residence in May. “These women are standing up for us, they are fighting against women abuse, something that means a lot to me,” she said. In memory of Zolile, a group with Senamile wore T-shirts with the 21-year-old first year quantity surveying student. Senamile was one of hundreds of of women who donned black and red and marched from Curries Fountain to the Durban City Hall as part of the national #TotalShutdown. The marches also signalled the start of Women’s Month. Among the marchers were KwaZulu-Natal’s first lady Zodwa Mchunu, eThekwini Mayor Zandile Khumalo and South African Minister of Water and Environmental Affairs Edna Molewa.                  The Mercury
