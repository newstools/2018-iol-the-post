Durban - A KwaZulu-Natal police branch commander is the fourth person to be arrested in connection with a murder in Muden earlier this month. The officer, a Warrant Officer at Muden along with Sergeant Mxolisi Abednigo Hadebe, Constable Ntethelelo Zamokuhle Hlophe and Constable Sboniso Perfect Mlungisi Mchunu are charged with murder, assault and defeating the ends of justice. The four appeared in the Greytown Magistrates Court on Wednesday and will on Friday make their formal bail application. It is understood that Hadebe, Hlophe and Mchunu were expected to apply for bail on Wednesday but the arrest of the commander may have lead to their application date to be changed. Background Earlier this month, the officers allegedly picked up three men and took them to the Muden SAPS holding cells. Independent Police Investigative Directorate spokesperson, Moses Dlamini said the officers allegedly tortured the men and one of them died. The officers then allegedly tried to hide the man’s body, however his family raised the alarm when he failed to return home. The matter was reported to police who claimed that the man had left the station. The family then reported the man’s disappearance to Ipid. Dlamini said Ipid head, Robert McBride, attend Wednesday’s court proceedings. “He encouraged Ipid investigators involved in the case and spoke out against the use of old Apartheid torture tactics. He further implored police to use modern methods to solve crime,” Dlamini said. The four policemen are due in court on Friday, August 24. Daily News
