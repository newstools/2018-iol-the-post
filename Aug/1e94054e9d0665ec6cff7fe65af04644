Durban - On Wednesday, hundreds of women are expected to take part in the #TotalShutDown march. In Durban, women are due to gather at Curries Fountain at 8am. The march is due to end at the Durban City Hall.  #TotalShutDown organisers said the event is to speak out about gender-based violence and will take place across the country. #TheTotalShutdown spokesperson, Lucy Nomhle Bowles, said they just decided that (gender-based violence) has to be stopped and that cannot be normalised. “Women are no longer safe to walk alone without being whistled at by men; we need to start protecting the women in our country,” she said. Various unions and civil society organisations have backed #TheTotalShutdown campaign, including the SA Federation of Trade Unions and Information advocacy group, Right2Know            If you are taking part in the march, make sure to upload your photographs and tag @DailyNewsSA Daily News
