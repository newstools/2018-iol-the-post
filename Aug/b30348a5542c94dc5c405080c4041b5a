Durban - eThekwini Metro Police is grossly understaffed, having recruited about less than the average 100 offers per year for the past night years. This is according to Head of Metro Police, Commissioner Steve Middleton. He was speaking at the municipality’s stakeholder session on crime prevention, held at the City Hall on Monday. Highlighting the challenges to the effective bylaw enforcement, Middleton said the last time Metro Police recruited was nine years ago. “Last year, we recruited 200 officers and are currently on a drive to recruit about 400 more. These recruits will undergo training before they are ready to hit the streets in about six to eight months,” Middleton said. Currently, there were just over 2 500 officers working in shifts. Taking into account the city’s surface area, this left one-eighth of an officer on the ground at any given time for every square kilometre. Middleton said it was difficult to maintain visibility with these numbers.      Applications for the current recruitment drive close on Friday September 7 at midday. Applications forms are available only at Durban Metropolitan Police Training Academy in Pinetown. They are to be submitted personally at Metropolitan Police Training Academy in Pinetown Lahee Park only between 9am and 2pm. Requirements: Matric certificate Grade 12; a drivers licence; have no criminal record or disability; aged between 18 and 35 years old; all copies must be certified; available contact number and you must be physically fit.
