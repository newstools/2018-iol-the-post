KZN MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta), Nomusa Dube-Ncube unveiled a replica of the 1962 Austin Westminster used to ferry Nelson Mandela prior to his capture by apartheid operatives in 1962. According to MEC Dube-Ncube, the unveiling of this car marks a key moment in the efforts by the provincial government to ensure that the history of our country is never forgotten. The unveiling ceremony attended by mayors of the uMgungundlovu District began with a 5km Fun walk which started at Midmar Dam and ended at the Capture Site. Wreaths were also laid at the site as part of the commemoration.
