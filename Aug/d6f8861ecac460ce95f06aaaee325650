Durban -  Morningside mother Megan Prins, who is alleged to have suffocated her 7-year-old son, will report to Fort Napier in Pietermaritzburg for a mental evaluation on August 22. Prins, 34, a project manager in the medical field, appeared in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Monday. The court heard that a bed had become available at Fort Napier. Prins charged with murder, is accused of overdosing her son Sloan, and thereafter suffocating him at an uMhlanga guest house in June. The Sunday Tribune had reported that the mother had attempted to take her own life by slitting her wrists after her son’s death. The owner of the uMhlanga guest house, who did not want to be named, said their family were left traumatised by the incident and had to seek counselling. Prins will appear in court on August 22 before heading to Fort Napier Hospital. She is currently an awaiting trial prisoner at Westville Prison. DAILY NEWS
