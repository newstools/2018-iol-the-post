Durban - Judgment is expected to be handed down in the Durban High Court on Tuesday in a murder case that gripped Durban for the last four years. Murder accused, Blaine Raman, is due to appear in court on charges relating to the kidnap and murder of Overport arts student, Kurtlee Pillay. In February 2016, Raman’s co-accused, Dinesh Nana and Bilal Tayob pleaded guilty to kidnapping and being accessories after the fact to both the murder and robbery. Raman had initially been arrested with Nana and Tayob and charges were withdrawn against him. The charges were re-instated shortly after Nana and Tayob’s guilty plea and sentence. Tayob received a suspended sentence and Nana is serving an eight-year sentence. Tayob and Nana alleged that Raman lured Pillay on the night of the killing on the pretext of car trouble. They said Raman then stabbed Pillay and took his car. Pillay’s car, a blue VW Golf, was traced to a Durban hotel on November 5, 2014. The accused said on the night of Pillay’s murder, they had consumed copious amounts of drugs and alcohol. Daily News
