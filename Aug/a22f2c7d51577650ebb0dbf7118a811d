Durban - The bail application of three men alleged to have killed two siblings in December last year, by throwing rocks at the car they were travelling in, is currently underway at the Verulam Magistrate's Court. Selvan Govender, 46, his son Nathan Govender, 23, and Qiniso Bhekithemba Gumbi, 20, have been each charged with two counts of murder. Amina Haffajee, 16, and her young brother Abdul-Rahim, 7, was travelling with an elder male on the N2 towards Stanger on December 27, when their white Toyota Corolla was struck with a large boulder. Both died before reaching a hospital. One of the arguments the State has laid before the court is the interference of witnesses. It emerged during court proceedings that at least five of the State witnesses are minors - aged between 9 and 16. During cross-examination investigating officer, Detective Warrant Officer Ivan Padayachee, said that if granted bail there was a great chance that the accused would interfere with State witnesses. However, defense attorney, Rajendra Nathalal argued that the trio did not know the state witnesses despite the state claiming otherwise. Padayachee said the witnesses lived in the same town as the accused and stood firmly in his stance that the accused would interfere with them. “They are also young and can be easily influenced.” The bail application continues.
