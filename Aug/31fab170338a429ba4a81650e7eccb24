Durban - In an effort to educate and create awareness on a variety of legislation that affects the community, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) will hold a provincial campaign. The 4 days campaign- from August 28 August 31- will take place in Mtubatuba, Dundee, and Umgababa on the South Coast. The campaign is aimed at unpacking various legislations which include the Liquor Act, National Gambling Act and the Consumer Protection act among others. Dr Rob Davies, Minister of Trade and Industry, wants the campaign to educate the public about the socio-economic impact of alcohol abuse, legal and illegal gambling activities. They will also be educated about debt relief measures for over-indebted households, credit affordability, and fundamental consumer rights. “During the public consultations on the Liquor and Gambling Amendment Bills that the DTI conducted throughout the country in 2016, it became evident that many members of the public were not well-informed about their rights and responsibilities,” said Minister Davies. “It is against this background that we took a decision to roll out another campaign that will not focus only on liquor and gambling laws but also on other laws that have an impact on the citizens of South Africa. "This campaign will raise awareness amongst members of the public on various legislation that government has put in place to protect them and to assist them to deal with a variety of challenges that affect them,” adds Minister Davies.
