The KZN branch was accused of being a hindrance to the revolution if the conference was stymied any further. Commentators are saying that there seems to be a generation battle playing itself out because the youth are of the opinion that younger leaders need to be elected to senior positions. The immediate challenge facing the ANC is to reunite the different factions. Any split will be detrimental to the voter support base and the possibility of losing power in the 2019 elections. The bottom line is that it is not going to be an easy road for President Cyril Ramaphosa. He has to do a balancing act to make sure the ANC remains a united force. Tough days and months lie ahead for the party. Letâ€™s be positive that members emerge from this conference united because it is only with a common vision that service delivery to the poor and marginalised can be a reality. POST
