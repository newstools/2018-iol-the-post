DURBAN - FOUR years after the death of 'Baby X, judgment day is looming for the alleged killer of ‘Baby X’. In November 2015, the weak, scarred body of the three-year-old girl from Havenside in Chatsworth was found at her home. She had allegedly been killed by her mother and grandmother, then 31-years-old and 54-years-old, following harrowing abuse. Her grandmother died in jail in April, while awaiting judgment. Baby X’s mother, now 35, will appear at the Durban High Court on September 20 to face judgment following accusations of torture and ultimately murder. Dr Sibusiso Ntsele told the Durban High Court that the cause of death was “blunt force trauma following fatal child abuse”. POST reported this week that the grandmother had once throttled and repeatedly threw Baby X onto the ground, according to the State. The following day, the mother allegedly hit the child with a high heel shoe, with her grandmother later joining in. On the same night, a plastic packet was placed over the child’s head before she went to sleep. She died the following day. The women also allegedly tortured Baby X’s 11-year-old brother and 8-year-old sister, allegedly beating them, forcing them to beg and assaulting them by pinching or beating at their genitals. Baby X’s siblings have since been taken to a place of safety. The mother, meanwhile, is claiming through her lawyer that following a car accident prior to Baby X's death, she was mentally impaired and currently has the mental capacity of a child between 9 and 16-years-old.
