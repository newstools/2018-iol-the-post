Durban -  A 28-year-old man who allegedly strangled pensioners and slit their throat before making off with their belongings, is expected to appear in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate's Court on Friday morning. According to KwaZulu Natal police spokesman Lt Colonel Thulani Zwane, the suspect has been positively linked to the murder of the three victims aged between 88 and 92 years of age. The attack took place in three different old age homes in the Pietermaritzburg Central Business District. According to Zwane, in the first two incidents, the suspect allegedly ransacked the homes of the victims, took their belongings, strangled them and stabbed them with a pair of scissors before fleeing on foot. "The recent incident took place on July 31, where an 89-year-old woman was attacked by the suspect. Her throat was also slit and she died at the scene." Zwane said in the last incident a television set and jewelry was taken. "The Pietermaritzburg police officers strengthened their patrols around these homes." He added that the suspect was still being profiled to check if he is linked to other housebreaking cases reported in the CBD and surrounding areas. The suspects face three counts of murder and housebreaking. DAILY NEWS
