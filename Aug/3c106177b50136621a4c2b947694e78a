Durban - Sexual assaults against children is a worldwide problem and South African children rights activist Alvin Brijlal believes harsher punishments and convictions is the answer to putting an end against these crimes. Brijlal's sentiments come in the wake of the rape and attempted murder of a minor girl near her home in South Delhi, India. IANS reported that the 11-year-old girl had gone to relieve herself on Wednesday night around 8.30pm near her home inÂ Rangpuri Pahad area of South Delhi when she was attacked by a masked youth. The youth allegedly violated her after dragging her to a secluded place. "The accused also strangulated her in a bid to wipe out the evidence. When the victim fell unconscious, he dumped her in a pit," said the Deputy Commissioner of Police Devendra Arya. "The victim was spotted by some passers-by who informed her father. Later, she was taken to AIIMS Trauma Centre where she underwent a surgery." Arya said on the basis of the description given by the victim, police detained 15 local youths who were questioned. Brijlal said on the other hand countries needed to have laws similar to Saudi Arabia, which beheaded people found guilty of rape. "It may seem inhumane but this will put an end to these crimes. In South Africa children are raped and murdered on a daily basis. We need to ask ourselves how experienced are our magistrates and prosecutors to handle these cases. In order for us to get justice for the crimes against our children we need to ensure the best people are leading the cases."Brijlal said this must also be adopted in other countries.
