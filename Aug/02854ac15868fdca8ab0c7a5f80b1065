Durban - The KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Mxolisi Kaunda, has asked the police to work around the clock, to find a truck driver who knocked and killed traffic officer Thokozani Gcinani Cele, while on duty in Estcourt on Sunday. According to Department of Transport spokesman, Kwanele Ncalane, preliminary reports indicate that Cele, 41, and his colleagues were on duty doing a speed arrest. "During the operation, a truck failed to stop and knocked him. Cele died instantly and the driver of the truck fled the scene." A case of hit and run was opened at Ladysmith SAPS. Kwanele said police were following all possible leads to bring the suspect to book. MEC Kaunda described the incident a "huge blo to the traffic fraternity and a setback to the department’s commitment to save lives on the road. “This a great loss to the department. The manner in which Cele died was unfortunate as it clearly indicates that the suspect is an irresponsible driver, as he failed to stop. "Road users must understand that traffic officers are on the road to keep them safe. Kaunda has urged all law enforcement officers to strain every nerve to find the suspect. Anyone who may have witnessed the incident must assist the police with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspect,” added  Kaunda. Kaunda expressed deepest condolences to Cele's family. He also called upon the police to exercise extreme caution as they execute their duties to protect the lives of the people of KwaZulu-Natal. KZN police spokesman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said Cele had been performing his duties on the  N3 Freeway Northbound when he was knocked by a truck. Mbele said a case of culpable homicide was being investigated. DAILY NEWS
