Durban -  The National Development Agency (NDA) has slammed reports that a man, going by the name of Mr Dlamini, is trying to fleece Early Childhood Development (ECD) centres, across the country, out of thousands of Rands. In a statement issued on Monday,  NDA Chief Executive Officer, Thamo Mzobe, said they were alerted to cases in the Free State as well as unrecorded incidents in KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo. “The NDA would like to put on record that there are no mobile learning classrooms that have been allocated nor will be distributed by a ‘Mr Dlamini’ who claims to be a Director at the Department of Social Development. He informs the ECD centres that based on a database provided by the NDA, he is travelling from KwaZulu Natal to deliver the classrooms – he says he requires an amount of R2 000, from the ECD to pay for tollgates. After receiving the money, he does not deliver,” Mzobe said. She said it was sad there was an individual who would use ECD centres to his advantage. The NDA supports ECDs in the country through various interventions that would be communicated through official documents. At no point will a NDA official make verbal undertakings that cannot be accounted for or documented. “I am pleading with ECD centres to be cautious and to verify the identity of those who approach them. We will follow up with those affected by the scam and are seeking legal advice on the matter,” Mzobe said. She said the NDA will be contacting law enforcement agencies to ensure that this person is brought to book. “People who have been scammed by this person are encouraged to approach their local police stations and make contact with their nearest NDA office,” she said.
