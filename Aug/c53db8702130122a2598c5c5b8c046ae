Durban - Prepare to pay almost R16 a litre for fuel in September, the AA announced this week. Petrol is expected to increase between 23 and 25 cents a litre while diesel could rise by around 28 cents. “This will, for the first time, push the cost of 93 unleaded octane fuel inland above the R16 a litre mark, a significant barrier,” the AA notes. Looking to the future, the AA says the September outlook is bleak. According to the AA, International petroleum prices remained virtually unchanged on average during August, “But, the Rand lost substantial ground against the US dollar, increasing the landed price of fuels." The association was commenting after looking at unaudited month end fuel price data which was supplied by the Central Energy Fund. "The Rand remains under pressure and a recent spike in international oil prices could mean more pain at the pumps if it continues. A return to cheap fuels doesn't look likely and consumers will continue to be forced to economise.” POST
