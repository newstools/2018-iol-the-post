Abdul Rahman Khan, 69, his wife Fathima Bibi, daughter Waheeda and son Fardeen, both in their 30s, died early on Saturday at the corner of Dr Yusuf Dadoo and Anton Lembede streets in the Durban CBD. Two people in the other vehicle were seriously injured. Garrith Jamieson, of Rescue Care Paramedics, said he arrived on the scene to find chaos. “Two vehicles had collided in a T-bone format at the junction and crashed into a fast food outlet.” One of the vehicles came to rest on its roof. Khan worked as a driver for the Al-Ansaar Foundation. While the family declined to comment, the foundation’s Krish Naidoo described the deaths as a “great loss”. “Their deaths have left the community reeling in shock. Rahman was a highly respected, pleasant man who was very simple in nature. He worked for the foundation for about seven years. He was someone who was ever willing to extend his services.” Naidoo said the foundation would be holding a memorial service in Rahman’s honour. Police are investigating. POST
