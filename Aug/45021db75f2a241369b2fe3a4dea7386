Star Life, an HD lifestyle channel, created exclusively for African audiences, will be broadcast in English around the clock. A glitzy launch attended by local celebrities, comedian Riaad Moosa and award-winning actress Leeanda Reddy, was held at the Michelangelo Hotel in Sandton on Thursday. The channel’s senior vice-president and business head for UK/Europe and South Africa, Gaurav Jandwani, said Star Life would offer the ultimate package in Indian entertainment. “Eighteen months ago we got into discussions to get the channel in South Africa. We did extensive consumer research to understand what made people tick, laugh, cry, etc. The findings resonated with what we wanted to bring to the table. People wanted to see stories of love, of family, inspiring stories of women beating the odds. People wanted to see the extraordinary journeys that people take. “We are proud to bring to Africa engaging programming in English as we learned that it’s not only Indian people that enjoy these shows, which will leave our viewers inspired, rejuvenated, moved and delighted.” Star Life will broadcast on channel 167 on DStv, channel 117 on OVHD and channel 23 on GOtv. Some shows on offer include the talk show Koffee with Karan hosted by film director, producer and actor Karan Johar; and the reality show Let’s Dance, where contestants compete in various dance forms. The romantic series with a twist, Where the Heart Belongs, and the legal drama The Threshold will also debut in Africa. POST
