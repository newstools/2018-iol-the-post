For the Phoenix Child Welfare Society, two homes are just the start, as the need is quite big judging by the number of children it caters for. These children are currently living with foster parents. “There are 236 children from Phoenix, Mount Moriah and Mount Royal needing to be re-homed and only 36 foster homes,” said Phoenix Child Welfare director Aroona Chetty. “Every day we get abused kids under our care and it’s hard when we don’t have much resources to work with. Having the home means it will be much easier to integrate these children back into society.” Two cottages stand tall in Triplen Circle, Lenham, one already complete and another almost ready. “This project has been on the cards for a while. It has been a long-term vision for the society,” said Chetty. The homes will be ready for occupation next month. “The kids and their house mothers will get to move in soon. We are busy finalising the furniture and getting donations, so we can put the furniture in,” said Chetty. The society’s president, Sham Maharaj, said: “Our first project when we established was to build a shelter for abandoned women and children. Now, 10 years later it’s running well on its own.” Maharaj said once there were more funds, they planned to build two more cottages and a dining room. “As the welfare, we get people who want to feed, or donate food. If we have the dining room we can add a storage room to keep food so we can make it last longer.” POST
