Durban - Before she left for school on Monday morning, Sadia Sukhraj prayed for her little brother Jaziel. On Tuesday, hundreds of mourners gathered at the Chatsworth Revival Centre in Unit 11 to pray for the little girl who is no more. Wearing her silver headband, Sadia looked angelic and at peace in her small white coffin. Her devastated mother Lorraine, who cried “I want my baby back” as she entered the church, rested her head on her husband Shailendra’s shoulder, softly mouthing her daughter’s name. As a slide show with the child’s photos played, the mourners watched teary-eyed. Chatsworth SAPS Captain Cheryl Pillay, carrying a bouquet of flowers, led a team of about 20 officers into the church. As each officer expressed their condolences they also wiped away tears. Anesh Singh, principal of Everest Heights Primary School that Sadia attended, said he had known her family for 25 years. “Her death has left us all devastated. She was a little girl who made an impact. My teachers feel as though they lost one of their own. "She created an impact wherever she went. Even our scholar patrol guard cried uncontrollably because she always had a good word for him.” Devika Sukhraj, who lives with the family in Shallcross, told POST: “She was a lovely child, always smiling and always bubbly. On Monday she woke up and couldn’t stop thanking me for a pen I gave her on Sunday night. “She then played with her seven-month-old brother and prayed for him.” POST
