Durban - A Phoenix woman who lost her eyesight after being shot three times, allegedly by her lover of 18 months, had twice obtained a protection order against him - including the day before she was shot. This was revealed in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court last week by the police investigating officer, Warrant Officer PJ Moodley. Moodley had successfully opposed bail for the accused, Nadraj “Alvin” Naidoo, 49, of Evengreen Circle, Greenbury. Seated in the dock with his head hung low, the father of five, who was charged for the attempted murder of Catherine Govender, 42, did not flinch upon hearing the outcome. “We have met with the victim; she had expressed her fear for the accused. She is still highly traumatised and is terrified after the incident,” said Moodley. “It was also found that the victim had sought a domestic violence protection order against the accused on two different occasions, with the most recent on May 23, a day before the shooting.” Moodley said the justice system had a responsibility and duty to protect Govender. “This matter is of a serious nature and we cannot allow the accused to get bail.” Govender, who is recovering at home, was shot through the temple, chest and abdomen, after being allegedly dragged down a flight of stairs to the second floor of her Ironbridge Road flat. Her mother, Manormoney Naicker, had said at the time her daughter had ended the relationship with Naidoo the previous night. “There was a lot of tension between them. Catherine had told him she wanted to end the relationship,” she had told POST. POST
