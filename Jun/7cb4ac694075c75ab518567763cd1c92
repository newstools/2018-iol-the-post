Durban - Verulam Athletic Club also boasts a runner who will be vying for his 26th Comrades run. Krish Naidoo like so many others, started running this gruelling ultra-marathon just to prove that he could, and once he had completed his first, the bug had bitten and there was no turning back. “There is something special about being part of this international event and prestigious run. “Once the starter’s gun goes off, all you can think of is the long road ahead. There are thousands of runners ahead of you and thousands behind. "You just have to get into a stride and keep going,” said Naidoo. Incidentally, there will be 67 Naidoos taking part this year, with the most common surname being Dlamini at 122. Also representing Verulam Athletic Club will be Raymond Muthen, who will be attempting to win his 20th medal. Praveen Sewnarain will aim to get his eighth medal. POST
