Yegs Naidoo had been making his way to the Sarva Dharma Ashram in Welbedacht on Tuesday morning when he was stabbed to death. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said an 18-year-old man had been arrested in connection with the murder and appeared in court on Tuesday. “On 11 June a motorist was travelling along Welbedacht Road when he noticed an elderly person being stabbed on the side of the road. The driver rendered assistance and apprehended the suspect,” said Mbhele. “Whilst awaiting the arrival of police, the suspect fled from the driver. Police, together with the vigilant community members, managed to apprehend the suspect. “The victim later succumbed to his injuries at the scene. SAPS Chatsworth is investigating a case of murder.” Selvan Moodley of the Arena Park CPF said Naidoo was a good man in the community who always went out of his way to help people. POST
