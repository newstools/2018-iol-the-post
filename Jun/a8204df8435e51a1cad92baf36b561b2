Durban - Veteran dancer Kumari Ambigay has described the death of Indian classical dancer, Latoya Khaba, who trained under her from the time she was 6 years old, as a huge loss. An emotional Ambigay told POST that the 23 year old who was "a natural dancer", suddenly fell ill on Tuesday morning, and took her last breathe a few hours later. Khaba, who does Bharatanatyam dancing, was set to leave to India later in the year to pursue her studies in dance and music. "Latoya was one of my star pupils....Talking about her now, it doesn't even feel as though she is gone.” Reminiscing Ambigay said Khaba had told her adopted mother Banu that she wanted to dance like Ambigay. "So her mom decided to enrol her for one of my classes when she was six, and she was a natural from day one, all I did was nurture her talent,” said Ambigay. “Latoya and I had plans to open dance schools in areas like Umlazi, but now she is gone." A memorial will take place soon. POST
