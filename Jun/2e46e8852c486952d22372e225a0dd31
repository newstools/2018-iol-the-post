Inspired by her musically inclined father, Preetesh Singh, 14-year-old Shriya, who goes by the pseudonym ‘Shrix’, said she hopes the video, which is a duet performance with her father, will reach a wide
audience. The cover mash-up has already received airplay and has featured regularly on Lotus FM and Radio Hindvani since February. Shrix said although she has always loved music, she only truly acknowledged her musical dreams at the beginning of 2017. “When I was a little girl, I simply loved music and enjoyed expressing myself through music. "I gave my first stage performance in ballet at the age of 4, and as time went on, my passion for music developed and so did my quest to start singing. “My dad was a big influence as he is a singer himself, and part of my inspiration was him, as I wanted to do what he did, which is to perform. "I am also inspired by artists like Shawn Mendes and South Korean boy group BTS. Talking about her choice of songs for her first cover mash-up, Shrix said she is a big fan of The Chainsmokers and Channa Mereya is her favourite Bollywood song from the movie Ae Dil hai Mushkil. “These were always going to be the songs I would make my debut with. "The mash-up has been done before but as a solo by YouTuber, Vidya Vox. The duet version with my dad creates a new dimension to it,” she said. The Grade 9 pupil at Westville Girls High School, who is also a part of the school choir, said she is currently working on her next mash-up. “I am working on another mash-up, similar to the one we have just done. As I am a big fan of k-pop (Korean pop), I hope to release a cover of BTS’s song Fake Love as well as single cover songs. “ I am also writing my own originals and hope to release my own CD in future. I am going to have to put in a lot of work, which I believe I can do and hope to inspire others to follow their dreams,” she said. The music video will be available from Wednesday, June 20, on the YouTube channel, Shrix Singh. POST
