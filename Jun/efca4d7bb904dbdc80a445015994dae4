“These words by Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessing upon him), ‘Verily, God is beautiful, and He loves beauty’, have inspired us through dress and architecture, and manifest in a special way on Eid-ul-Fitr. “Muslims celebrate by dressing their best. In South Africa, we have modernised the traditional black abaya to a more simplistic everyday wearable essential, not only in black, also in a rainbow of colours of the season. "Our ‘LBD’, Legendary Black Dress (not Little Black Dress) is a staple piece for every Muslimah as it is versatile and comfortable,” said Achilles. Other trends: * Khamissa trend. There is an inherent glamour to the kimono, a garment with a beautiful Japanese history. We have mashed the colourful prints and textures with our traditional open abaya. Eid 2018 winter edition uses brocades and velvets for this trend. * Colourblock and cold- shoulder trend. The trend took a hiatus and is back this year with an unusual twist. Designers are using some neutral colour-blocked pieces to create the cold-shoulder trend, which could only be worn with layering, but using the neutral palette. * Colour. Colour continues to be the powerhouse for designers and a key influencer of fashion trends. Ceylon yellow is the trend this year for its exotic and spicy feel. * Head covers. Scarf styling has evolved into many designs of silk blends bow, scarves and ready-to-wear turbans. Whatever your style, you will find a head cover you like at your local markets. Anyone can tie a wonderful headwrap in less than a minute thanks to ready-made turbans and a healthy supply of “how to” tutorials on YouTube for your Eid scarf pinning. POST
