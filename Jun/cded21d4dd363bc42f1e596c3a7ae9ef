Durban - An 11-month-old baby girl has been brought to safety after robbers hijacked her mother and grandmother, forcing them out of their new Mercedes-Benz not knowing she was strapped in her rear car seat. The Avoca family had been leaving home to go to a local grocery store on Monday evening when the hijackers pounced. Rodger Kistnasamy, 52, of Parthab Road in Avoca, said his wife, daughter-in-law and her baby were “thankfully” unharmed. He said they had just opened the driveway gate to leave when a silver VW Polo stopped outside the property. “A gang of three armed men ran up to them and told them they wanted the vehicle. "They forced them out of the vehicle, shouting: ‘Make it quick’ and ‘Get off’. My wife, Latacia, and daughter-in-law pleaded (for the criminals) to leave them alone and to let them to take the baby out first. Before they reversed out, they allowed the baby to be removed.” Kistnasamy said he had just bought the white Mercedes-Benz, and believed suspects were targeting this particular brand to use in other robberies. He said his 48-year-old wife was shaken, but fine. He plans to take her for counselling to deal with the trauma. Kistnasamy was himself a victim of crime nine years ago when he was beaten with the butt of a gun after robbers were unable to find any valuables in his safe during a home invasion. “Sometimes we feel like prisoners in our own home. All we want is to live peacefully,” he said. “It took me four years to get over the first incident.” He said he had posted a 24-hour guard outside his home following the hijacking. His vehicle was recovered about 45 minutes later in Richmond Farm through a tracking service. However, the robbers got away with the baby’s Ferrari car seat, a handbag, cellphone and Latacia’s wedding ring of 24 years. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said no arrests had been made. POST
