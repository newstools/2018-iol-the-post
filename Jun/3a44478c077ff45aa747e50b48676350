Durban - A gang of hijackers returned a baby to their mother, minutes after realising the car they hijacked had the child in the backseat, said Blue Security community and media liaison officer, Andreas Mathios. Mathios said four armed men hijacked a vehicle in Parthab Road in Avoca at around 6.55pm on Monday night, not realising that they had "a passenger on board." “The gang arrived outside the property in a Silver Polo and hijacked a resident of her vehicle. "But as they fled the scene they noticed that the baby was still sitting in the back seat of the vehicle. "They stopped the car and returned the child to the victim,” Mathios said. “The hijackers then fled in the stolen vehicle which also contained the victim’s purse, keys and cellphone. "A vehicle tracking firm later traced and recovered the vehicle,” Mathios said. In a separate hijacking in Shepstone Road in New Germany on Tuesday morning two armed men hijacked a motorist outside a business premises at around 8.50am. “The suspects approached the motorist on foot and held up him up at gunpoint, ordering him to lie down on the road. They took his vehicle and fled in the direction of Kwadabeka. An iPad and iPhone were also stolen with the vehicle,” Mathios said. Mathios advised residents to be alert when pulling into driveways or stopping outside business premises. "Be vigilant and make sure there are no suspicious vehicles or individuals loitering nearby or across the road. "Always stop parallel to the verge while waiting for gates to open so that you can’t be jammed into the driveway and can drive away easily if necessary. "If you feel uncomfortable rather drive off in the direction of the nearest police station and contact your security company and the police for assistance,” Mathios said. POST
