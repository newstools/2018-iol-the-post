Durban - His face still swollen, a Verulam man accused of raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter repeatedly over a period of five years, appeared in the Verulam Family Court on Monday. The 43-year-old mechanic, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the child, could barely stand, sit or lift his head as he sat in the dock. He claimed he had suffered multiple injuries to his ears, eyes, lip, head, back and ribs as a result of being assaulted by security guards and community members. He is facing charges of rape and sexual assault after being alleged to have held his stepdaughter captive in their home and using her as a sex slave in a dirty room with newspaper used to seal the windows. The child was also allegedly subjected to sexual acts with sex toys and made to dress in sexy lingerie. He also allegedly prostituted her to other men in order to supplement his income. The man, who first appeared in court two weeks ago, said he had been taken to hospital since his last appearance, and had only received painkillers. His newly appointed Legal Aid lawyer Mondli Mthethwa, also told the court that his client was diabetic and had not received adequate medical care. He said his client had been assaulted and had opened cases at the Phoenix and Verulam SAPS. Mthethwa requested that his client’s medical report be made available to him by the State. Chief Magistrate Irfaan Khalil said the accused would be moved from the Verulam SAPS holding cells to Westville Prison, pending his formal bail application in July. He also ordered that he receive medical treatment. Angry community members who were allowed in the courtroom cursed on hearing he would be applying for bail and vowed to make him “pay” for what he is alleged to have done. POST
