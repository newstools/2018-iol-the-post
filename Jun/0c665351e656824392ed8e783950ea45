Durban - A Verulam stepfather accused of allegedly raping his 10 year old stepdaughter will remain behind bars until his next court appearance, later this month. The 43 year old mechanic had difficulty walking into court on Thursday, four days after his arrest. When the Magistrate asked him to stand in the dock, the accused said he was unable to do so because of his injuries, and the court ordered a full medical assessment before his next appearance. On Monday, the man was apprehended by Reaction Unit SA, after community members brought the alleged rape to their attention. The man, who faces charges of rape and sexual assault, was then taken to a state hospital after he was allegedly assaulted by members of the community. The accused claimed to have suffered multiple injuries to his ears, eyes, lip, head, back and ribs. He will be held at the Verulam SAPS until his next court appearance. Meanwhile angry community members gathered outside court, holding placards and demanding justice for the little girl. The child who was allegedly living alone with her stepfather is now in a place of safety. POST
