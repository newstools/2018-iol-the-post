Founder and chairperson of the non-profit organisation, Caring Sisters Network, a social and charitable division of the SA Muslim Network, Yasiera Mahomed Suliman and her team of volunteers embarked on their annual signature Eid-Gift Smile campaign, which will provide hampers to 3300 children from 50 Islamic teaching institutions and orphanages across the province. “Our motto is to, ‘Put a smile on the dial of a child for Eid’. This year, packing took place from the end of May until June 2,” she said. “All items for the gifts were donated by our huge network of members, friends and
families. “The packing day is the highlight of our year’s
calender. “Our venue is abuzz with activity with mothers and children streaming in from early in the morning with sweets and other treats to add to the 
gifts. “It’s a day of excitement, where everyone in attendance wants to add a smile for the underprivileged children.” The 2018 Eid gift consists of a sports utility bag, a backpack; a comforter set; stationery; toiletries; lunch box and breakfast groceries; essential plastic-ware; winter clothing; prayer items; sweets and treats; and toys and games - all the essentials and more to bring joy to the children for Eid.
