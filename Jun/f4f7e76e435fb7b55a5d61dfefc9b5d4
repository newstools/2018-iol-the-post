Durban - Ansuriya Reddy has grown up wanting for nothing, so it broke her heart to see her schoolmates go hungry. The Grade R Highlands Primary School pupil gave away her four-slice lunch to hungry classmates. When her worried mother asked why her child was coming home and running to the pot on the stove, she was not prepared for the answer. “My little girl was thinking like an adult. She told me she couldn’t bear to see the plight of other pupils, knowing she was well fed, so she gave her lunch away,” said Beverly Reddy. “It upset me at first, but then I realised what a kind soul my child was and how she wanted to help and make a difference. I went to the school to discuss a way forward with the principal and his staff.” Seven years later, the 12-year-old has managed to find sponsors and various groups to provide lunch for 68 of the underprivileged pupils. “We also give lunch every Tuesday to learners. Lunch always varies - it used to be polony, cold meat and viennas but since the listeriosis outbreak we give baked beans, tinned fish and potato curry, for instance. “Ansuriya’s lunch is no different from what we give the kids.
