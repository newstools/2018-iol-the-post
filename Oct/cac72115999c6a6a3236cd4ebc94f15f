“I don’t think the issue is about TV licences but rather about how the funds are being spent. When I was a (board) member, we ran the SABC like a business. "We maximised the adverts, the revenues and other sources of income. We didn’t have overpaid executives and that’s a problem at the moment,” said Trikamjee. Advocate Robin Sewlal, an associate director of journalism at the Durban University of Technology, said while the SABC was in a position to demand payment of licence fees, like other public broadcasters around the world, it had to continuously meet its public mandate and satisfy the needs of all South Africans. “The (alleged) squandering of funds at the SABC in recent years has largely contributed to people losing their faith in the broadcaster. The nature and extent of fruitless and wasteful expenditure has led to the broadcaster falling into disfavour with many citizens. The public outcry cannot be faulted. “This has had a direct impact on the payment of licence fees. In the past couple of weeks, the SABC presented a fairly comprehensive turnaround strategy. That will do good by the current board and executive management.” Sewlal said the SABC had to demonstrate its commitment by addressing recent audit findings and delivering effectively and efficiently. “In so doing, it would be moving in the right direction to regain public trust and support.” Former Isidingo star Jack Devnarian, who had previously accepted a nomination to serve on the SABC board, has questioned what the public has benefited by paying the licence fee. “The SABC traditionally relied on TV licences as an income model and it continues to rely (on it) even though voices questioning the need grows louder and louder. The SABC needs to have a constructive meeting with broadcast stakeholders and media experts and interrogate these questions. I believe civil society will also need to lend their voice.” POST
