Durban - Phoenix triple murder accused Colin Pillay abandoned his bail application at the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Pillay, 45, faces charges of three counts of premeditated murder and one of robbery with aggravating circumstances for the brutal murders of Jane Govindsamy, 45, an employee at a logistics company and her daughters Denisha, 22, and Rackelle, 16,  Grade 11 pupil at Rydal Park Secondary. Their bodies were found by their father Sagren Govindsamy at their home in Longcroft, Phoenix on September 21. Pillay's attornery, Chris Gounden, said they were unable to go ahead with the bail application because they are waiting for statements Pillay had made to police. The matter was adjourned to November 28. Outside the courthouse families of the deceased were protesting. Jane's sister Annie Ganasparsdh said all they wanted was justice. "We want a full sentence for this crime and we appeal to anyone with information which can assist with the investigation to come forward." POST
