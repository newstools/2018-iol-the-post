Durban - The National Funeral Practitioners Association of South Africa has demanded that the remains of a Ladysmith woman be given to her family so that she may be buried as per the culture and traditions of her family. Nafupa SA secretary general, Nkosentsha Shezi, said it was inhumane that the woman's body remained at the funeral parlour for the last four years. On Tuesday, Democratic Alliance leader in KwaZulu-Natal, Zwakele Mncwango, conducted an oversight visit at the Mchunu Funeral Parlour where the woman’s body was stored. He called on the premier and relevant government departments in the province to conduct an investigation into how the woman’s body remained at the parlour since 2014. “It is imperative that as custodians of our culture, traditions and rituals relating to burials it is that we add our voice in this unfolding travesty of both cultural rights and economic rights,” he said. Shezi said part of the problem was the tender system. He said this did not level the field for all service providers. He added that when a bereaved family chooses a service provider to handle the funeral and they cannot pay, then a pauper’s funeral is conducted. He said monies could also come from a fund that will be paid for by government and should not be used to infringe of the family’s right to chose. Shezi said Nafupa SA believed that all parties can come to an amicable solution as the government has a constitutional obligation to help bury the deceased. “At the same time government does not provide the service but must respect the wishes of the late boyfriend and pay the funeral parlour owner for burial. As an organisation we are calling on ANC-led government to work together with funeral associations to ensure that black emerging businesses are given a fair share of government procurement,” he said.
