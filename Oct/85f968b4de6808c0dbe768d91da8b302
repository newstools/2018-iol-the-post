Durban - A two-year-old boy who was kidnapped following a dispute was reunited with his mother this yesterday. The toddler was found by police. It is believed that he was taken by a woman who then called his mother, her landlady and demanded a ransom of R20 000. The alleged kidnapper was renting a room at the back of the family home. At the time, the mother said her two female tenants had offered to take care of the little boy while she ran errands. When the woman returned, the two tenants were nowhere to be found. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said the mother reported the matter to Phoenix SAPS. "A case of kidnapping was opened and assigned to FCS Unit. The suspect who had taken the child was traced to the Nongoma area where he was found with the child," Zwane said. Zwane said the 32-year-old accused was arrested and detained at the Phoenix police station and the toddler handed back to his other. The man has appeared in the Verulam Magistrate's Court yesterday. He is due back in court next week. Daily News
