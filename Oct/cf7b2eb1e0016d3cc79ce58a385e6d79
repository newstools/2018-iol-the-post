Durban - The family of slain businessman Kidesh Ramjettan are planning to oppose the bail application of the three men arrested for his murder. Ayanda Shezi, Menziwa Mdakana and Zakhele Dubazane, all aged between 32 and 34, are expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court today for a bail application. They were arrested last week after a Johannesburg-based policeman linked one of the accused to Ramjettan’s murder. The accused appeared in court last week and were remanded. Ramjettan, 37, was at his petrol station in Rossburgh when he was gunned down. Video footage shows him speaking to a customer, who was seated in his vehicle, and seconds later, a man limps towards Ramjettan, pulls out a gun and shoots him in the head before fleeing. Family spokesperson Anesh Balraj said: “We feel a sense of relief that there have been arrests but there isn’t any closure. We don’t understand the motive.” POST
