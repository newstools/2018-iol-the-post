Durban - One person was killed and three others injured in a serious collision on the M1 Higginson Highway offramp on Sunday morning. According to Garrith Jamieson, operations director at Rescue Care, paramedics arrived on scene just after 7am to find that two vehicles had collided on the highway before both vehicles left the roadway down the bank colliding into trees. The accident took place near the Unit 5, R K Khans offramp. "Three occupants were found to be severely entrapped in the wreckage and the Durban Fire Department had to use the Jaws of Life to cut the injured free whilst Advanced Life Support Paramedics stabilised them in the vehicle. "Once freed the injured were carefully extricated before being carried up the bank to awaiting ambulances. The driver of one of the vehicles had sustained major injuries and unfortunately, there was nothing more paramedics could do for him and he was declared deceased on the scene." In a separate accident, a biker believed to be in his 30s was killed in an accident on Edwin Swales Drive near the onramp to the M4 Bluff in the early hours of Saturday morning. "Rescue Care Paramedics arrived on the scene around 01:20am to find the biker critically injured. Advanced Life Support Paramedics were called to assist and worked on the man for approximately one hour trying to resuscitate him, however, his injuries were too severe and he passed away on the scene. No other vehicle was involved in the crash," said Jamieson. SAPS were on scene for both accidents. Daily News
