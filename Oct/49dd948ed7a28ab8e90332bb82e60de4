Durban - A Phoenix father who pleaded guilty to strangling and killing his son, is expected to be sentenced in the Durban High Court on Wednesday. Pravin Kubair, 30, had walked his 4-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son, Rinaldo Elijah to a local park where he strangled the boy using a rope in April 2017. In August Kubair pleaded guilty to the crime citing he was desperate to end the pain of seeing his family torn apart. Kubair had been estranged from his wife following a tumultuous relationship. Before he could commit the crime, Kubair said he had sent his wife a WhatsApp message saying, “I am taking what’s mine”, in his plea statement. He further stated that he had also planned on killing his daughter but she had fallen asleep and did not witness her brother’s death. Judge Mohini Moodley accepted the guilty plea and convicted Kubair accordingly. During addressing of sentencing, defence attorney, Sizwe Masondo argued that a life sentence would rob him of a chance at rehabilitation and that he had already been punished as he would be haunted for life for his actions. State advocate Denardo MacDonald argued that this was an “open and shut” case. He argued that the deceased was killed by a person he knew, his father, who he probably considered to be a protector and a hero. “He used this (murder) as revenge, to punish his wife. It was all about him (Kubair). He said he did it because his family was falling apart. It was actually the family getting rid of the ‘rotten apple’ and when he saw he was excluded from their life, he could not take that. “To punish his wife, he took away from her what every mother holds most valuable...her children. The rehabilitation that he needs can be found in prison. The accused does not deserve to be in our society. His sentence (life) should also serve as a deterrent,” said MacDonald. POST
