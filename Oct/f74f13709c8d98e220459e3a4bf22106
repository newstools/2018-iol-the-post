Durban - Residents living on the same road in Reservoir Hills as the suspected kingpin of the Verulam mosque attack said they were living in fear. Speaking to POST this week, one of the residents in Nugget Road who live a few metres away from accused Farhard Hoomer said: “We are honestly living in fear. Imagine if he wanted to harm us. He could have easily done it." Another resident said he was "scared" to say too much, for fear that his home could also be targeted. Hoomer, and 18 others were arrested in October for the alleged bomb threats in and around Durban as well as the attack on the Imam Hussein Mosque in Verulam that left Abbas Essop dead and two others injured. When POST visited Hoomer's home this week, the windows were open and laundry was on the line, but the doors were closed and no one could be seen. The businessman and father of eight will appear in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Tuesday for a continuation of the bail application. They face a raft of charges, including terrorism, murder, attempted murder, extortion, kidnapping, contravention of the Explosives Act and arson. On Monday, the court heard that eight Islamic State flags were found at his home during police raids. Hoomers was identified by a kidnap victim as the mastermind of the group. Originally 19 men were arrested. Charges against seven were provisionally withdrawn. Another accused Goolam Mahomed Rasheed Haffejee, 37, of Parlock, an employee at a hardware store, was released on R100 000 bail. The remaining 10 in police custody, are: Thabit Said Mwenda, 28, of Reservoir Hills; Mohammed Akbar, 21, of Umbilo; Mohammed Seidth, 24, of Reservoir Hills; Amani Mayan, of Reservoir Hills; Abubakari Ali, 41, of Overport; Abasi Juma, 41, of the DRC; Muhammed Adil Sobrun, 19, of Durban; and Burundi nationals Omar Iddy, 38, and Ndikumana Shabani Umande, 42, and Ahmad Haffejee, 28, of Eshowe Hills.
