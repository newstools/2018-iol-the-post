Durban - Police have launched a full investigation following a video of a policeman who appears to be under the influence of alcohol while on duty. According to police spokesperson, Brigadier Jay Naicker, the video which has gone viral, is under investigation in terms of the police disciplinary regulations. "According to the Station Commander of the Mountain Rise police station, the Constable responded to a complaint at Copesville Drive in the early hours of Sunday morning when the complainants realized that he was highly intoxicated. "The incident was immediately brought to the attention of his commander who booked him off duty and reported his conduct to the station commander. "Both he and the constable who was driving him on that day are under investigation. Although the driver was sober, the fact that he failed to act against his colleague is also viewed as serious misconduct and a senior officer has been appointed to investigate the matter. "The Constable in the video has been restricted to desk duties and his firearm was removed whilst he is under investigation." Naicker thanked theÂ members of the public that blow the whistle on corruption and misconduct within the ranks of the South African Police Services. "We view such behavior in a very serious light and will always act against errant police officers as we believe that we need police officers of the highest caliber to deliver on our mandate."
