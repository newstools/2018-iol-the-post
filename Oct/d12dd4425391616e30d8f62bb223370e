SANDF members dismissed after being found guilty of misconduct and desertion Durban - The Military Command Council (MCC) took a decision to administratively dismiss 43 members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) who broke curfew and knowingly deserted their posts while operationally deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2015. Department of Defence Head of Communication, Siphiwe Dlamini, said desertion in the military is regarded as a schedule 1 offence detrimental to the security of personnel and equipment and may lead to the loss of life and equipment of those deployed in the Mission Area. “Through their transgression and misconduct, the 43 members breached and violated the SANDF Military Discipline Supplementary Measures Act and Code of Conduct as well as the United Nations (UN) Code of Conduct for Peacekeepers. “The SANDF strongly condemns and reiterates that any act of ill-discipline by its members will not be tolerated nor condoned no matter the circumstances under which the acts were committed. It is expected that members of the SANDF conduct themselves in accordance with all prescripts of the constitution of the Republic of South Africa and the Defence Act,” he said. The dismissed members subsequently lodged an appeal with the Gauteng High Court which in turn ruled against the SANDF`s decision. “The SANDF is currently studying the outcome of the judgement which will inform the next step to be taken by the SANDF regarding the matter,” said Dlamini.
