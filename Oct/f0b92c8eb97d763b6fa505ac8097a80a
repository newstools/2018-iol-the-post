Durban - “We are a friendly city and we want to keep it as such,” this was the response by the eThekwini Municipality who has condemned the littering taking place along the Durban beachfront. This week, a video showing filth strewn along the beachfront went viral. The city’s acting head of communications, Mandla Nsele, said they are urging residents to keep the beaches clean by throwing dirt in the bins provided along the beachfront. “The huge number of visitors to the beachfront these past weekends have meant an increase in the amount of trash along the beaches. Our beaches are a major tourist drawcard for the municipality and we cannot afford to have it dirty, more especially as we approach the festive season,” Nsele said. He said Durban is a friendly city and the municipality wants to keep it that way. “We condemn the littering and are appealing to visitors and residents to be responsible for their own waste and to use the bins provided. Cleanliness is everyone’s responsibility and we should bear that in mind at all times to keep our beaches, beach parking bays and the promenade free of litter. Among other things we will embark on educational campaigns on the significance of cleanliness and how is it of to all of us,” he said. Metro Police have been instructed to conduct regular patrols around the beach and control traffic congestion. For the upcoming festive season in particular, traffic to the beach front is going to be immensely controlled to guard against our people smuggling alcohol to the beach area. Minibus taxis are going to be parked at the holding area with its occupants walking to the beach area. Even the holding area will be closely monitored to ensure that litter is disposed of in trash bins available. Metro Police have been directed to enforce by-laws and have no mercy to those disregarding them. The Mercury
