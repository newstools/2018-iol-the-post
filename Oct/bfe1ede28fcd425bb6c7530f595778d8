Durban - It is called Operation Take Back and it has the community divided on whether or not it should be implemented across the city. However, the ANC believes the idea is "disgusting, humiliating and appalling". Last week, a photograph surfaced on Facebook of a police officer screening the fingerprints of a vagrant in Westville. According to the Westville Crime and Info Group on Facebook, ‘beggars’ in Westville will be identified, have their fingerprints taken and put on a register. The post further states that each ‘beggar’  will have to sign their details and note that if they are caught begging in the leafy Durban suburb, they will be arrested. According to the post, all fingerprints will be vetted to see if they match fingerprints at crime scenes or if there are any outstanding warrants of arrest for those who have been ‘vetted’, including those who pose as car guards and those who beg at traffic intersections. ANC provincial spokesperson, Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu, said they are going to lodge a formal complaint with the Human Rights Commission. “Our country comes from an ugly past and this takes us back to the dompas,” she said. Simelane-Zulu said the behaviour of the police and Westville Community Policing Forum is a direct violation of the constitution and must be condemned. “The history of the ANC for 106 years is for restoring the dignity of our people. We will not stand for this,” she said. The ANC has tasked the Transport, Community Safety and Liaison MEC with launching an investigation into the legalities of the operations. Meanwhile, national police spokesperson, Brigadier Vish Naidoo, said he had seen the social media posts. He added that it was not something that police would encourage. “It is clearly unconstitutional,” he said. The Mercury
