Durban - An elderly man who was beaten to death in an alleged robbery at his home in Manor Gardens was found on Tuesday morning by Blue Security. According to media liaison officer Andreas Mathios, it is believed the pensioner had been dead for two days. "He was found bound and gagged in his bedroom," said Mathios.
