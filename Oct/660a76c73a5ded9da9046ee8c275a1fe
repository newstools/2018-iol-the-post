Durban - Disaster management teams have been placed on standby in KwaZulu-Natal. This decision by the MEC for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Nomusa, Dube-Ncube, follows weather reports that a cold front is expected to sweep through the province starting from Wednesday and Thursday. “Gail force winds and heavy rains which could lead to localised flooding in coastal areas, with snowfall in the southern and central parts of the Drakensberg,” read the statement. Dube-Ncube also urged motorists to drive carefully. “As a province we take this weather alert seriously and we are monitoring the situation especially in areas that we know are prone to flooding. “We are urging all motorists to be extra vigilant as roads can become slippery. We call for extra caution to be applied when crossing bridges especially in low lying areas. We also urge residents to not cross walkways or rivers. Those residing in low lying areas are urged to seek shelter on higher ground”. Nearly a year ago massive winds and storms struck the city with a record 108mm of rain failing in 24 hours flooding large areas of South Durban. The Independent on Saturday
