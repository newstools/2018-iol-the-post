Durban - Two men received life sentences for the 2016 murder of KwaDukuza businessman Marshal Naidoo. According to KZN police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, Naidoo, 28, was at his supermarket in South Village, Gledhow Mini Market in March 2016 when he was fatally shot. Naidoo's mother and a customer were wounded during the shooting. Siphamandla Sangweni, 29, and Philani Khambule, 26, were jailed for life in the Durban High Court this week. Both Sangweni and Khambule each received 15 years each for business robbery and a further eight years for two counts of attempted murder. According to Mbele the suspects made off with cash and other items before fleeing in a Mercedes Benz belonging to one the victims. "It was later found abandoned about a kilometre away from the scene. A case of armed robbery, murder and two counts of attempted murder was opened at KwaDukuza police station for further investigation," said Mbele. In April 2016, a month after the attack, both suspects were arrested. Daily News
