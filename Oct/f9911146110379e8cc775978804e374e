Durban -Â The 19 suspects allegedly linked to a spate of bomb scares in and around Durban will appear in the Verulam Family Court on Tuesday. The suspects who police allege are also linked to the attack on the Imam Hussein Mosque in Verulam where Abbas Essop was killed in May, made their first appearance on Monday. They face charges of terrorism, murder, attempted murder, extortion, kidnapping, contravention of the Explosive Act and arson. Court proceedings will once again be held in camera and media and family will not be allowed in the courtroom. Simphiwe Mhlongo, Hawks KZN spokesperson, said the nature of the case is at a sensitive stage and an ID parade is expected to take place this week. Between March and August this year, Durban and surrounding areas were plagued with several incidents of placing and detonating of these devices including widespread hoax callers. The 19 suspects were arrested last week Friday in and around Durban by an integrated team involving the Hawks (Crimes Against the State), Crime Intelligence, the Forensic Unit, the National Prosecuting Authority including other departments from the justice cluster.
