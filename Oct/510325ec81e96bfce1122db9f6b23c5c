Durban - A 53-year-old man who allegedly shot dead his girlfriend and her mother in Tongaat at the weekend, has handed himself over to police. The man, who is employed as a security guard, is accused of entering the women’s home in Fairbreeze, Tongaat, on Saturday and shooting dead 33-year-old Nombuso Dube and her 70-year-old mother, Mtokozile Dube. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said the man handed himself to police at the Pietermaritzburg police station yesterday. “He was then transferred to Tongaat police station. He will be charged with two counts of murder,” she said. Mbele said a licensed firearm, suspected to have been used during the shooting, was also recovered. The suspect is due to appear in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court soon. The women’s bodies were found on Monday, two days after the incident. Mbele said the women were killed in what is believed to have been a domestic dispute. Daily News
