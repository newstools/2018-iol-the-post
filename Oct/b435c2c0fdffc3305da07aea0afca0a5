“I love doing it, it is the act of preparing a tray that will be exchanged or gifted to someone very close to you and your family, I love the tradition of doing this with my family, and I also love brainstorming something different every year,” she says. Known for gifting some of the most amazing out-of-the-box ideas, Naidoo explained how she goes about selecting how their treats will be presented. “When I plan my Diwali gifting ideas, I always look at what will happen to the actual item left behind once all the sweetmeats are eaten. “I am always looking for something that is on trend but still has the Eastern ‘tinge’ to it. I always want the person to remember us by using the board or box years later.” One of their first gifts was a small wooden board that had an eastern print down the side. Another was a white granite cheese board and most recently a tea box, each with a selection of her favourite sweetmeats. “It is pretty traditional and I only do cute bite-sized sweetmeats.” Commenting on where she sources the items for her trays, Naidoo said: “I always check with different suppliers, I call around and always negotiate for the best prices, sometimes I get them well in advance from an overseas supplier or from a local catering supplier.” Like many working moms, Naidoo juggles work and home and opts to buy her sweetmeats rather than make them. “I used to make my own sweetmeats but now I opt for purchasing because of time constraints. My little ones and I set up the trays and wrap them, they have tons of fun and we enjoy doing it as a family. My nannies also assist as we make at least 150 trays in one evening. “I have had the same sweetmeat supplier for the past five years and especially love their burfi. I use Treats At Home from Arbee Centre in Reservoir Hills. “It’s always fresh and in cute little bite-sized cup cake holders, and Ayub and Husna are super-friendly and helpful,” said Naidoo. POST
