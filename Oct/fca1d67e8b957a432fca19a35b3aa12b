Durban - The families of murdered Malvern mother, Nalin Naidu, will have to wait until Wednesday as judgement was postponed in the Durban High Court on Friday. Judgement was expected in the case of former policeman turned businessman Sifiso Nkosi, and his fiancée, Phumla Ethel Nkosi, who is alleged to have killed Naidu in 2014. They were part of six people who were arrested and charged for Naidu's brutal murder. Naidu had gone missing from the Malvern mall. Her body was found in a bush in Shongweni on October 29, 2014. Her throat had been slit and she suffered facial injuries. Nkosi and Matseke had been on the run for six months before they were arrested. The duo have been awaiting trial prisoners since their arrest in 2015. The alleged Naidu's husband Seelan who died in 2016 as an awaiting trial prisoner, was the mastermind for the killing. The matter was adjourned to October 10 and transferred to the Durban Regional Court. Daily News
