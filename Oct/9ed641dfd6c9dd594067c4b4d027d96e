Durban - KZN police have confirmed that no case has been reported to police regarding a Verulam man who allegedly had sex with a cat on Friday. Reaction Unit SA director, Prem Balram said they received a call from a female who informed the controller on duty that her neighbour was having sex with her pet cat. "The woman said she had walked to his residence to investigate the screams of her pet when she found the naked man holding the cat by rear legs and penetrating the animal." Balram said when officers entered the home and found the man dressing and his pants was covered in cat hair." However, Caroline Smith, General Manager of Durban & Coast SPCA, said that they were waiting for the cat to be brought into their offices and for the vet to check if there was any harm done to the cat. Smith said it seems that the owner seems to be retracting her statement. "Hopefully we can get the cat here to be assessed and if there is any proof of bestiality we will open a case at SAPS."
