Durban - Pietermaritzburg businessman Rajivee Soni will apply for leave to appeal his murder conviction on November 21 in the Durban High Court. Soni was jailed to 30 years in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Friday for the 2013 murder of Pietermaritzburg doctor Bhavish Sewram. Sewram was gunned down outside his surgery in Chota Motala Road, Raisethorpe. The father of two died at the scene. According to National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson, Natasha Kara Ramkisson, Soni and Sewram shared a close relationship up until January 2012 when Soni suspected that his wife and Sewram were involved in a romantic relationship. Soni decided to kill Sewram and enlisted the help of former policeman Brian Treasurer with an offer of R100 000 to carry out the deed. Treasurer accepted and then enlisted the services of Mfaniseni Nxumalo and Sabelo Dlamini, promising to pay them if they assisted him. On 13 May 2013, Treasurer, Nxumalo and Dlamini drove to the doctor’s surgery. Treasurer waited in the vehicle, while Dlamini went out and shot the deceased who died at the scene. All were sentenced to life in imprisonment. Treasurer died in prison. The Director of Public Prosecutions in KwaZulu Natal, Advocate Moipone Noko said, “I welcome the sentence and conviction in this matter. I hope this sentence will assist in curbing the scourge of violence and killings that is currently reining in our Province. Congratulations to the Prosecutor on a job well done.” Daily News
