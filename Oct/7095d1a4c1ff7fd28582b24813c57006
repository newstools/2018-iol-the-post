Hoomer’s advocate, Jimmy Howse, said his client and co-accused Goolam Haffejee, 37, of Parlock, had not been singled out in the identity parade. Haffejee was released on R100 000 bail earlier this month. Howse said the only link to the three alleged kingpins - Hoomer, Haffejee and his cousin Ahmad Haffejee - was the signal from a cellphone tower close to the Imam Hussein Mosque in Verulam. The State had claimed that soon after the deadly attack at the mosque, a white Hyundai Getz had been seen fleeing the scene. It claimed that the same colour and make of vehicle was found in Fullham Road, Reservoir Hills during Hoomer’s arrest. The State said this linked him to the mosque attack. Howse, however, dismissed the claim. He said Hoomer owned a white Hyundai i10 which he bought in July, two months after the attack. He further disputed that Hoomer had rented the property in Fulham Road. Howse said the property belonged to a Loganathan Moodley and had been rented to a man named Akbar. This is the same property where an explosive device was found. With regards to the extortion charges, Howse said the State failed to prove the dealings between Hoomer and the three businesses Hoomer allegedly extorted money from. In respect of the explosive device found at Woolworths in uMhlanga, Howse said the only link police had made was a white Polo, similar to the one Hoomer owned. He confirmed that Hoomer owned a property at 8 Nugget Road, Reservoir Hills. “The property is divided into two parts. One section is occupied by his second wife and their two children. The other portion - the basement - is where the kidnapped victim was found. The basement was being rented out.” The bail application will continue on November 6. POST
