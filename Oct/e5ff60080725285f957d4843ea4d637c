Durban - Over the last six years, there has been a sharp decline in the number of police reservists. National police minister, Bheki Cele revealed that by May 31, 2018 the number of Category A reservists was a mere 3 002 in comparison with 17 939 on May 31, 2012 and that the number of Category D reservists was 4 087 in comparison to 32 524 in the same period. The Freedom Front Plus is now taking the minister to task, adding that referring to reservists as Category A and D reservists is inaccurate as since 2014, reservists are categorised as either Category 1 or 2. "According to this Instruction, Category A reservists who were operational reservists now fall under Category 1 along with former Category D reservists who were rural reservists," the FFP's Dr Pieter Groenewald said. He said that the decline in the number of police reservists was of great concern. Groenewald added that the decrease in reservists showed that the police's call for the community to become involved and support the police with their policing function was not effective. "The minister and the police must be serious about gaining support from the community. They should make use of reservists because they come from the community and can make important contributions in the fight against crime," Groenewald said. He said reservists are volunteers who sacrifice their time, without compensation, to help the police combat crime in South Africa. "Budget-related factors cannot be used as an excuse for the sharp decline," Groenewald said.
