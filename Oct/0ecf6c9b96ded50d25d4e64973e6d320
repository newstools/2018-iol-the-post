Durban - Durbanites can expect to stay in doors tonight as a forecaster from the South African Weather Services says it will rain throughout the night. While a weather warning has been put out for heavy rain possibly leading to floods from Port Edward through to Richards Bay, Thandiwe Gumede said it the rain will start to clear from tomorrow. “For the rest of today there will be rain and there is a 80% chance of heavy rains leading to thunder showers in the Northern parts of KZN so that's Ladysmith and Giants Castle to name a few but that will be confined to the North. "We have also put out a weather warning for heavy rain leading to flooding from Port Edward through to Richards Bay but we will begin to see the rain clear from tomorrow and it will start clearing in the  West. There will still be some rain for parts over the North and East.” Speaking on Snow, Gumede said while it is snowing along the berg, there is disruptive snow falling on the southern parts that's Kokstad, Underberg and Giants Castle. And for those looking to go out along the coast, Gumede recommends they stay indoors as there is “high gale force winds and rough seas with waves going as high as 5.5meters”. POST
