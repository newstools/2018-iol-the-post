Durban - Despite the family of murdered Durban businessman, Kidesh Ramjettan offering a R300 000 reward for any information that could lead to the arrest and conviction of his killer, no one has come forward. Ramjettan, 37, a father of one, was shot dead outside his business Glaze Motors Engen garage in Rossburgh on August 22. According to KZN police spokesman, Lt Colonel Thulani Zwane, Ramjettan had been talking to a friend outside his business when an unknown suspect approached him and opened fire. The family initially offered a reward of R50 000. CCTV footage shows the suspect shooting Ramjettan and fleeing on foot. Family spokesperson Prethumb Bechan told the Sunday Tribune: “Police have told us that there have not been viable leads yet, and that is why the family has raised this money as a reward for information leading to the suspect’s arrest."
