Durban - A Lenasia South crime fighter who died in hospital after he was shot in a botched hijacking on Saturday has been described as "one of a kind" by the community. Jitesh 'Casper' Ranchod 43, a bottle store owner, died hours after the shooting. He had been dropping off employees at the corner of Lancester and Wimbledon Roads when he was gunned down. A police source close to the investigation said the father of two, immediately reversed his vehicle and drove to the nearest hospital where he later died. Community member Avi Padayachee said Ranchod was always there to assist and support the Lenasia South community. Both had been members of the Sector 3 Lenasia South Patrollers, a community crime-fighting initiative. "Being a patroller is a thankless job, where one can get discouraged, but this never bothered Casper, in fact, he was a person that never whined about anything and encouraged others to do the same, to improve the lives of all in Lenasia south." Ranchod's funeral took place on Monday at the Avalon Crematorium. POST
