Durban - Congress of South African Trade Unions will on Friday add their voices to the masses calling for an end to the upsurge in the price of petrol. Cosatu KwaZulu-Natal provincial secretary, Edwin Mkhize, a protest will take place at the Mariannhill Toll Plaza from 10am. Mkhize said they view the constant increase of the petrol price as a serious indictment. “If we continue to be dormant in resolving this crisis, South Africans will continue to suffer the perpetual increase in the cost of living. We first condemned the petrol price hike in June this year,” he said. Mkhize said Cosatu has noticed that there is general discontent in society about the fuel increase as well as the increase in Value Added Tax which does not match or come close to the salaries earned by workers. This, Mkhize said, has led to a situation in which the lives of the poor people become more and more difficult. “Many commentators have argued that over the past ten years the fuel prize has increased up to 66% from R4.9c per litre to R15.49. This year alone South Africans have witnessed four consecutive increases. It is high time we must rise and oppose this irrational increase in petrol and the reversal of the recent VAT increase. The failure by our government to address levels of inequality in our society, a situation where the gap between the rich and poor continue to expand, making it a permanent feature of our society, which is what qualifies any country to be a capitalist country,” he said. Mkhize said the picket has been planned by Cosatu but will be joined by other groups who have the same interests. Mkhize warned motorists to make the necessary travel arrangements on Friday.
