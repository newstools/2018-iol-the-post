Durban - Convicted fraudster, Kessie Nair, is refusing to give his social media account passwords to investigators. Nair, who made headlines last month for calling President Cyril Ramaphosa, the K-word, appeared in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court where he was due to apply for bail. In today’s court proceedings, the Hawks claimed that Nair was not assisting in the investigation.      Meanwhile, the State has opposed bail as they believe that Nair had already received threats after posting his video and could be a danger to himself. Nair, who is on the organ transplant list, said his health has already deteriorated while in custody and wants to be granted bail.      He believes that he should not be deprived of his liberty.      Magistrate Ncumisa Gcolotela ruled that Nair be sent to Fort Napier for mental evaluation as an in-patient. However, his lawyer, Chris Gounden, said the next bed available at the institution is only in April 2019. The matter was rolled over to allow for Gounden to prepare an affidavit for Nair's bail application. The Mercury
