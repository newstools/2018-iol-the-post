Durban - The South African African National Defence Force said it was in the process of discharging an officer who shot and killed his girlfriend in October last year. In June this year, Private (Pte) Elias Mogaki was found guilty of murdering his girlfriend Pte Nomathemba Ngeleka, also an SANDF member. Mogaki was sentenced to 20 years behind bars. Mogaki appealed the sentence and it was upheld. Mogaki and Ngeleka belonged to 5 South African Infantry Battalion (5 SAI) in Ladysmith and were at the time of the incident deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as part of the Force Intervention Brigade (FIB). "Pte Elias Mogaki tried to commit suicide immediately after the shooting incident and was stabilised in the DRC before being transferred to South Africa for further medical treatment. Upon his recovery, he was formally charged with murder," said spokesperson Brigadier General Mafi Mgobozi. Mgobozi said the SANDF was in the process of discharging Pte Mogaki. "He is currently detained at the Military Detention Barracks (DB) in Bloemfontein. Once discharged Mogaki will serve his sentence at the Rustenburg Correctional Services facility. "The SANDF will not tolerate any acts of ill-discipline, criminal activities, conduct detrimental to the Military Disciplinary Code (MDC) and the Code of Conduct amongst all its members, both military and civilian, regardless of position or rank level," concluded Brigadier Mgobozi.
