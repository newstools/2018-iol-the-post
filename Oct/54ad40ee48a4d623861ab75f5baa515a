Durban - A Mariannhill policeman was shot and killed outside his house in KwaNdengezi on Tuesday night. Warrant Officer Bhekisigcino Zethembe Khwela, 54, was standing outside his home and chatting to his friend at the time. His son was also present. National police spokesperson, Brigadier Vish Naidoo, said at least two gunmen, who were on foot, fired several shots at them. “Kwela was killed instantly after he was shot multiple times. His son was wounded and the friend escaped unscathed,” Naidoo said. Kwela’s death comes hours after an Eastern Cape officer was gunned down in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Naidoo said Captain Lumkile Wiseman, 50, was killed at Tshiwula Street in New Brighton in the Eastern Cape. “The member was stationed at the SAPS Protection and Security Services at King Williams Town but he was deployed to the New Brighton area temporarily,” he said. Both killings have been condemned by National Commissioner of Police, General Khehla John Sitole. “The motives for both incidents are not conclusive at this stage but form part of investigations. In both incidents the 72-hour Activation Plan is being implemented. The killing of our two colleagues yesterday is a reflection of what police must endure on a daily basis", Sitole said. He said he has instructed the Provincial Commissioners of both the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal to mobilise maximum resources to track down those responsible and bring them to book.
