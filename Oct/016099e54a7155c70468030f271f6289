Durban - The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) has issued a warning to the public about a recruitment scam on social media for possible jobs in the Military Skills Development System. Spokesperson Brigadier General Mafi Mgobozi warned the public toÂ ignore and report these fraudulent activities to the police or their nearest SANDF unit. He described the perpetrators as "faceless charlatans aimed at swindling the unsuspecting and vulnerable youth of their money." "The SANDF publishes application forms once a year, in January, in the various national newspapers and publishes these application forms on the SANDF website at the same time," said Brigadier General Mgobozi. Mgobozi said for any inquiries on legitimate application forms, or to verify timings for planned recruitment drives by the SANDF, the public is encouraged to call the SANDF Human Resources Acquisition office at (012) 339 5626 or (012) 339 5781 during office hours from Monday to Friday.
