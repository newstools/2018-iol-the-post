Durban - Any hopes of freedom were dashed for Durban businessman Rajiv Sewnarain, who was found guilty of killing his wife Shanaaz for the second time. Sewnarain was jailed for life following the 2010 murder of his wife Shanaaz. The couple had been married for 20 years. Shanaaz was shot dead execution-style and her body was found on the outskirts of Folweni (iSipingo). The Clairwood businessman was sentenced to life imprisonment on December 22, 2010, after he allegedly confessed to paying two hitmen R30 000 to kill his wife. Subsequent to his conviction and sentence, Sewnarain lodged a successful appeal in the Pietermaritzburg High Court where his conviction and sentence was set aside. A new trial was ordered. In March 2017 Sewnarain applied for bail pending his new trial which was denied by Magistrate Anand Maharaj. His new trial began in March 2018. He was found guilty in the Durban High Court. Daily News
