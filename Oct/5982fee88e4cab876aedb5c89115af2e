Durban - Residents are urged not to panic when they see snakes in or near their homes. That's according to snake catcher Jason Arnold from Universal Reptiles. According to Arnold while every season is snake season, we are currently in the snake mating season so snake sightings could occur. Earlier today Arnold was called out to Verulam where he found a 1.4 metre Mozambique Spitting Cobra outside a home in Dawncrest. According to Reaction Unit South Africa, last week the cobra was spotted by school children who took a video of their find. Today they were also called out and Arnold safely removed the snake from the property. Yesterday Arnold said he went to a home in Northdene where he caught a 2.1-metre black mamba. “It appears the snake must've entered via a cat flap or an open window which had plants growing up against the window on the outside. While it was not the biggest it was good to see that residents were concerned about the snake and did not try to attack it out of fear.” Arnold said if anyone sees a snake its best to stay calm, leave the room and call for help to remove it. Arnold will release the snakes at a safe area today. POST
