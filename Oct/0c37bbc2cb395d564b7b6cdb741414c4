Durban - A third person is expected to appear in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Friday morning linked to the alleged kidnapping of Sikhumbuzo Mjwara, the owner of uMhlanga’s upmarket Barrio Restaurant. Mjwara was reported missing on August 30 from outside the Verulam Magistrate's Court. He had allegedly been kidnapped by unknown persons. A third suspect, a 39-year-old security guard, was arrested on Thursday. His arrest comes hours after two policemen made their first appearance in the Verulam Magistrate's Court charged with kidnapping. Sergeant Thabane Cyril Ndlovu and Constable Collen Makhaye, both 37, are expected to apply for bail on Monday. They face charges of kidnapping. To date the businessman has not been found. The Sunday Tribune reported that Mjwara family would not talk about his disappearance as they feared for his life. He had reportedly been attending a civil case over a financial dispute at the Verulam Magistrate's Court on the day he was kidnapped. Daily News
