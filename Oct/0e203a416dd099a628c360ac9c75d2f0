Durban - The SPCA has refuted claims that a man had raped a cat in Verulam last week. This after the cat was examined following the alleged incident. SPCA Durban & Coast general manager, Caroline Smith, said the cat was examined on Monday by their chief vet. "There is no evidence to support the allegation that the cat was raped. The owner keeps changing her story so it seems that her accusations are baseless," Smith said. On Friday, Reaction Unit SA director, Prem Balram said they received a call from a female who informed the controller on duty that her neighbour was having sex with her pet cat. "The woman said she had walked to his residence to investigate the screams of her pet when she found the naked man holding the cat by rear legs and penetrating the animal," he said. Balram said when officers entered the home and found the man dressing and his pants was covered in cat hair. Balram said that the man had been accused of bestiality before with other animals in the area but no cases were opened due to the man's girlfriend pleading with the community to forgive him. KZN police said no case had been reported to them. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said if a person is caught engaging in sexual acts with an animal then they can be charged with bestiality. Advocate MoiponeÂ Noko added that the sentence will depend on the evidence and the merits of the case. Meanwhile, images of the man have been circulated on social media. Daily News
