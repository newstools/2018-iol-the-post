Durban - The family of a murdered pensioner hope that those responsible for his death will be arrested soon. Christopher Munro Biggs, 73, was found beaten, gagged and his hands and legs bound in his Manor Gardens home earlier today. It is believed that his body had been lying in one of the bedrooms for two days. Biggs' body was found by a Blue security guard who went in to investigate after construction workers said they had not seen the elderly resident. Andreas Mathios, Blue Security spokesperson, said the men had come to do work on Biggs' property but the elderly gentleman had not opened the gate for them as he usually did. He said the men suspected something was amiss and managed to flag down a passing Blue Security vehicle. "A security officer was dispatched to the home and discovered Biggs' body in the room," he said.   Biggs' son, Dean Biggs,  said his father was an active man for his age. "I came to visit my father on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I got a message from a friend down the road to say that there was bad news but she did not want to say what. I knew something had happened.  It was gruesome and you just never expect it to happen in your family circles. This is the first time we have experienced something like this. Sifiso, one of the builders who works for my dad and comes every Tuesday and Thursday found him," he said. Biggs' daughter, Meryl Knox, said she hoped the perpetrators were caught. "They cowardly beat an old man to death. Crime is totally out of control," she said.
