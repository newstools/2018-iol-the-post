Durban - The Department of Health said 1391 expected to graduate in nursing would bode well for the patients of KZN. "The graduation carries much significance for the nurses themselves and the people of KZN, as it means these healthcare professionals will be able to inject their newly-acquired skills into the public healthcare system, for the benefit of all," said Department spokesperson Agiza Hlongwane. The graduation will take place over Thursday and Friday at the Royal Agricultural Showgrounds in Pietermaritzburg. "After many hours of painstaking work, there is likely to be a euphoric atmosphere and scenes of joy among the nurses and their families as their new qualifications are conferred on them," said Hlongwane. The Department said there will be numerous qualifications that will be awarded, including specialist nursing categories such as Midwifery and Neonatal Nursing Science, Child Health Nursing Science and Critical Care Nursing Science among others.
