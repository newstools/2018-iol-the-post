Marshall Naidoo, 29, died in hospital and his mother, Sheila, was wounded after she was shot in the left leg during an armed robbery at their business premises in Gledhow, KwaDukuza, in March 2016. Siphamandla Sangweni, 29, and Philani Khambule, 26, were each sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, 15 years each for business robbery and a further eight years on each count of attempted murder. Sangweni and Khambule had entered the bottle store while Naidoo and his mother were cashing up. The suspects fired at them before fleeing with cash and other items. A supermarket next to the bottle store was being robbed at the same time. The robbers then attempted to hijack - and then shot - a motorist in the vicinity before fleeing. The getaway vehicle was found abandoned about a kilometre away. Naidoo was taken to hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. Naidoo’s sister, Marcell, said: “We are happy with the outcome. It has been a long and painful wait and we finally have closure knowing his killers have been brought to book.” She said their mother’s leg was permanently damaged and she used crutches. “Our mother underwent extensive treatment, but her leg will never be normal again. Although she is physically coping, the emotional pain will never go away.” POST
