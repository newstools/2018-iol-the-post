Durban - THE N2 North near Umgeni is closed to motorists. According to Garrith Jamieson from Rescue Care, the driver of a truck allegedly lost control and the truck veered off all four lanes on the N2 near the Umgeni off-ramp and collided with a car. “There were three occupants in the car and all three have sustained serious injuries. The driver of the truck has also sustained minor injury. The entire N2 north is closed at the Umgeni offramp as the truck is occupying all four lanes on the national highway.” Jamieson said traffic is backup as far as Spaghetti Junction. “I would guess it would take about half an hour just to make some space to get the traffic going but it will be at a snail's pace.” Motorists are urged to use either the M19 or branch of to Brickfield Road and use Alpine Road to make their way back to Umgeni as an alternate.
