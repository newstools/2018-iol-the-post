Durban - Ayanda Shezi, Menziwa Mdakana and Zakhele Dubazane, the three men accused of gunning down Durban petrol station owner, Kidesh Ramjettan, outside his Rossburgh business in August, are due back in court next week. The men, aged between 32 and 34, appeared in the Durban Magistrate's Court this morning. They were remanded in custody and will appear again on October 25. In court, the men said they wanted to be sent to Westville Prison as they were being assaulted while in custody at the police station. RamjettanÂ was standing outside in the parking lot of his Glazer Motors petrol station in Clairwood when a gunman walked up to him and shot him in the head. He died at the scene. Speaking to The Mercury outside the court, Ramjettan's family said they believed the reward of R300 000 offered led to the arrests of the three men.      Meanwhile, one of the man has allegedly confessed to police that they were paid out to carry a hit on Ramjettan's life. Shezi and Mdakane told the court they have enlisted the services of Advocate Jimmy Howse. Dubazane has legal aid. Family spokesperson, Niresh Singh said, they were desperate to find out the truth behind the father of one's murder. For this reason, they offered a reward in a bid to find answers. "The shooter did not take anything. The murder was committed execution style with a shot to the back of his head. The killer fired two more shots at his lifeless body before fleeing the scene on foot," Singh said.      He added that the family was baffled as to who would have wanted Kidesh dead. The Mercury
