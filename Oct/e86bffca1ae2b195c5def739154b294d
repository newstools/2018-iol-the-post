Durban - A second identity parade is to be held in the case against 11 men accused of masterminding a number of bomb scares in and around Durban. Thabit Said Mwenda, Mohammed Akbar, Mohammed Seidth, Amani Mayan, Abubakari Ali, Abasi Juma, Muhammed Adil Sobrun, Omar Iddy, Ndikumana Shabani Umande, Farhad Hoomer and Ahmad Haffejee appeared in the Verulam Magistrateâ€™s Court earlier today. The men are facing charges of murder, attempted murder, violation of the Explosives Act, arson, extortion and the illegal possession of firearms. Last week, one of the accused, Goolam Mahomed Rasheed Haffejee was granted R100 000 bail. This was because Haffejee was not pointed out in the ID parade held earlier. In court, it was revealed that another complainant had come forward and as a result, a second ID parade would need to be conducted. Initially, 19 men were arrested but by last week, the State had withdrawn charges against seven of the accused. The matter continues tomorrow in court. The Post
