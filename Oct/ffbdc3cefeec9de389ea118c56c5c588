Cape Town medical doctor Saumya Tiwari Gautam, 31, who was born in India and relocated to South Africa two years ago, intends suing Annulutchmee Thaver and Deon Ganas, of Mrs India-South Africa CC, for damages amounting to more than R1.2million. The summons was issued last Friday. Thaver and Ganas, who reside in Durban, have 10 days to reply. Gautam claims she had shown interest in the competition after it was advertised; and that the winner would receive a new VW Jetta valued at R300 000 and other prizes valued at R500 000. She is now requesting that the vehicle be delivered, or alternatively the current value of the car, being the sum of R419 000, be paid. Gautam, represented by Rajesh Hiralall Attorneys, said that prior to the pageant, she was offered a community service post at two hospitals with a monthly remuneration of R50 000. But upon being crowned, and in light of the duties which she was expected to perform during her 12-month reign, she declined the job offers. Gautam can only apply for a community service post in December and take up employment on January 1 next year. In the interim, she is unemployed. In lieu of suffering a loss of R50 000 per month (from July, 2018, to January 1, 2019), she is claiming R350 000 in damages and R15 000 for a brochure she allegedly purchased from the defendants. She claimed they failed to produce the brochure and had not repaid the money after she had cancelled the sale. Gautam, who also paid a registration and entrance fee of R17 000 to compete, is also asking they pay interest on the amounts at a rate of 10% per annum, the legal costs and further or alternate relief. Thaver and Ganas said they were consulting with their legal representatives. POST
