Durban - Police have confirmed that a third suspect has been arrested for theft after they allegedly scammed a teacher of R1.8 million. Police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said Pinetown police made a breakthrough in the case on Monday. "A 57-year-old teacher who was conned out of R1.8 million opened a case of theft in January. "The suspects first asked her to pay an amount of R20 000 for cleansing water for her and her boyfriend so that they can get married," said Gwala. She said in May, her boyfriend advised her to resign so that they can start a business. "She resigned and when she received her pension pay-out she gave it all to the boyfriend and his allies. The suspects, aged between 28 and 32, were arrested with the help of the community in Pinetown as they were looking for a place to rent." Pinetown police appeal to members of the community who might have fallen victim of the same scam to come forward and urgently contact Lieutenant Colonel Mwelase on 083 661 0358. Daily News
