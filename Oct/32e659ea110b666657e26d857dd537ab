Durban - Quick-thinking by Pinetown community members, led to the arrest of two people who allegedly conned a lady of R1.8 million. The suspects, who were arrested on Monday were looking for a place to rent when members of the community, who knew they had been wanted, contacted police. The accused, aged 28 and 32, are expected to undergo an identification parade today at the Durban Central SAPS. According to a police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, they were arrested following an investigation into a case that was opened in January. "A 57-year-old teacher was conned of her R1.8 million by two men who first asked her to pay an amount of R20 000 for cleansing water for her and her boyfriend so that they can get married. "In May 2018, her boyfriend advised her to resign so that they can start a business, she resigned and when she received her pension pay-out she gave it all to the boyfriend and his allies." Police are urging members of the community, who might have fallen victim to the same scam, to come forward and contact Lieutenant Colonel Mwelase 083 661 0358. POST
