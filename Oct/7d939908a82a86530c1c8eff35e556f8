Durban - When the Phoenix Animal Care and Treatment (PACT) found Brittany, a pitbull cross in June, she had a 5kg tumour growing from her abdomen and suffered severe weight loss. When PACT shared her story on their Facebook page it went viral with many calling for Brittany to be euthanized while others dubbed her the 'tumor dog'. But, today Brittany is healthy and active but in need of a home. Sharing her story, co-founder of PACT, Neeri Naidoo said Brittany was found in a home in Hazelmere. "The home-owner was doing renovations on the property when she found Brittany laying on the ground. The first thing she noticed was the tumour coming out of her abdomen. She did not know who her owners were." Naidoo said the woman gave her food and then took her to a vet. "The vet had told the woman operating on Brittany would be risky given the size of the tumor. The woman tried to locate her family to no avail. She then contacted us for help." When we arrived at the property Naidoo said she was shocked to see Brittany's condition. "We took her to our vet in Umhlanga. An x-ray was done on her and we found that she had other complications. We had to wait until she was fit enough to handle the operation. She was admitted at the vet for two weeks for treatment until her vital signs improved." Naidoo said the tumour was removed and Brittany's condition started to improve. "She was placed at two foster homes, but at the first home they dog did not get along with her and at the second she kept on jumping over the fence." Naidoo said it was so amazing to witness Brittany's recovery. "We are now looking for a foster or adoptive family for Brittany. Families will be screened. Members of PACT will do visits to check on her. There is also an adoption fees." For further details email: pact4068@gmail.com. POST
