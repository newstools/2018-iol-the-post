His family have opened a murder charge, claiming that the alleged assault led to his death. Father of three, Muhammed Shaik, 40, died on Sunday evening, two weeks after being admitted to the Magaliesburg Health Centre - a division of the Crescent of Hope South Africa organisation - on September 28. His nephew, Ibrahim Khan, said Shaik was allegedly assaulted a day after he was admitted in attempt to “control” him. “We were told by an eyewitness that he had been beaten and was left chained to a pole in the sun for almost an entire day. On September 30, we were contacted after he was taken to a public hospital for medical attention. “The centre claimed his state of unconsciousness was due to a drug overdose. However, the hospital found extensive damage to his head, which included a shift of his brain, swelling and blood clots. “There were also cuts on his head from being assaulted with what appeared to be a hard object, whip lashes on his back and legs, severe damage to his ribs and cigarette burns on his hand. “We moved him to a private hospital on October 2, where he was placed in ICU on life support but his condition deteriorated. The family was left with no choice but to turn the life support machine off. Muhammed was comatose, brain dead and had suffered multiple organ failures.” Khan said the family, of Lenasia in Johannesburg, were furious because he was placed in the centre in good faith and they have now opened a case of murder. “We were hoping he recovered but instead it appears that he was beaten up by the very people who were meant to assist him.” Attorney Yousha Tayob, who is representing the centre, said the matter was being investigated internally. “Once the investigation is concluded, we will then be able to act on the outcome.” Magaliesburg SAPS confirmed that a case of murder was being investigated. Shaik was buried at the Avalon Cemetery in Lenasia on Monday. POST
