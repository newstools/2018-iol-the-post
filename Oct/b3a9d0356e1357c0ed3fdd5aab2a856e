Durban - The family of a Phoenix businesswoman, who has been missing for three days, is offering a reward of R10 000 for positive information on her whereabouts. Michelle Govender, 38, who sells clothing, left her home in Longcroft for the Durban CBD to buy stock. Her husband, Deon, said he tried calling her at 10.40am but her phone went to voicemail. "At first I thought she turned her phone off because she did not want to take calls out of fear of being robbed. I waited until 11.30am to call back because that was the time she would usually return home. But again my call went to voicemail." Concerned, Govender said he contacted his 17-year-old daughter, who was at home studying for her matric final exams, to find out if Michelle had contacted her. "By 2pm, we had still not heard from her and her cellphone continued to go to voicemail. I became worried and left work to search for her in town on my own." Govender said none of the shop owners she dealt with had seen her. "I became scared thinking she was robbed or injured and drove to Addington Hospital to check if she was admitted but I was unable to locate her. I went to Durban Central SAPS and opened a missing person's case." When he got home, Govender contacted her family and friends but no one had seen or heard from her either. Since Monday, Govender said he has searched hospitals and mortuaries. "We managed to track her phone to Clermont but when we approached the suspect he dropped the phone and ran off." Govender said this made him fear the worse. "My daughters are devastated. My oldest is writing her matric examination and cannot even study or concentrate. I am offering a reward of R10 000 to anyone,  who can give us positive information on her whereabouts." Anyone with information, can call Deon on 084 691 8994. POST
