Durban - Kessie Nair, the man who called President Cyril Ramaphosa the K-word, is due back in court today. Last week Magistrate Ncumisa Gcolotela on Tuesday ruled that Nair be sent to Fort Napier Hospital in Pietermaritzburg as an in-patient for 28-days’ mental evaluation. Previously, Nair’s lawyer, Chris Gounden, had said a bed would only be available at the hospital in April next year. As a result of the long wait, Nair had asked that he be granted bail in the interim. Nair is facing seven counts of crimen injuria and two counts of incitement or commanding a person to commit an offence. Nair, 60, who has a string of previous convictions ranging from fraud and theft to illegal gambling and the theft of a motor vehicle, asked the court to consider his release based on his severe health conditions. He told the court that he was on a waiting list for a heart transplant and had already suffered severe health deterioration since his arrest last month. The court also heard that his heart was only functioning at 29% after he suffered a massive heart attack and had five coronary stents placed in him. The Mercury
