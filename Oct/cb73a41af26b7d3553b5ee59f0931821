Durban - For fitness enthusiasts, the 5km Point Park Run takes places every Saturday at uShaka Marine World. Park Run is a worldwide 5km free timed run which was initiated by a South African living in the UK. The first run took place in Bushy Park, Teddington, UK, in October 2004. There are now 1005 Park runs taking place worldwide, with uShaka now being the 164th participating venue in South Africa. In 2017, approximately 2526 people participated in the North Beach Park run, setting a new world record, said event organisers. These numbers created a need to locate a new venue and decision for the Park Run to start taking place uShaka Marine World at Village Walk. According to Fordyce, the CEO of Park Run SA, this particular run it is a truly fun event and quite unique since it goes through a retail space. This particular course begins at Marine and Bean Café at 8 am each Saturday morning, heads along the promenade, then south into uShaka Marine World Village Walk Shopping Complex, right through to the entrance of uShaka World. The course then heads back through Village walk, and onto the promenade, making it a 2 lap course starting at 7am and ending at 9am.
