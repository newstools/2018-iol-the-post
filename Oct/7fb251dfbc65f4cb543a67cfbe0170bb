Durban - Gift of the Givers will leave for Indonesia on Wednesday to offer assistance following a tsunami that struck the country last week. According to founder Imtiaz Sooliman,  the President of Indonesia appealed for international assistance on Monday. A 7,5 earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday which resulted in a tsunami. The death toll is expected to reach thousands. Sooliman said search and rescue teams with highly specialised equipment, accompanied by a select number of medical personnel will depart for Indonesia. "If necessary, a larger medical contingent, also with specialised equipment, will follow a day or two later dependent on the challenges presented. "Logistics, diplomacy, procurement of essential supplies including water, food, fuel and medicine, transport, security, and the detailed updated information is the current priority as we prepare for the departure of the teams from Gift of the Givers Logistics Centre in Bramley, Johannesburg," said Sooliman. He said information on the number of people killed, missing, injured, alive and trapped is difficult to come by with any certainty of accuracy given the inaccessibility of the area. "Deployment of our experienced teams in the heart of the disaster will yield that information first hand." Cash contributions to assist the victims of the disaster can be deposited into Gift of the Givers, Standard Bank, Pietermaritzburg, Account No: 052278611, Branch Code: 057525. Deposit slips can be emailed to sooliman@giftofthegivers.org Daily News
