Durban - An elderly couple and their two domestic workers had to be counselled after a brazen home robbery in uMhlanga Rocks, north of Durban, this morning. The couple along with the female domestic worker and a gardener, were pushed into a room in their Montague Road home while the gang of about four armed men sifted through their house for money and valuables. Marshall Security spokesperson, Kyle van Reenen, said the men entered the home by scaling the home’s boundary wall. They then forced entry into the house and pushed two elderly homeowners and two workers into a room. “The men armed men ransacked the house, taking with them an undisclosed amount of money and various electronic devices before fleeing in two awaiting getaway vehicles,” van Reenen said. He said although the victims did not suffer any physical injuries in the ordeal, they were left severely traumatised and the assistance of the North Durban Victim Support Team was brought in to counsel them. Durban North SAPS communications officer, Lieutenant Raymond Deokaran, confirmed that a case of house robbery had been opened. He said police are investigating further. Daily News
