Durban - Colin Pillay, the man accused of murdering a Phoenix mother and her two daughters, will have to wait another week to make his formal bail application. Pillay appeared in the Verulam Magistrate's Court this morning. He faces charges of three counts of premeditated murder and one of robbery with aggravating circumstances. State prosecutor, Rakesh Singh, said the state will allege that the murders were planned which places the offence in the ambit of schedule six. Pillay's lawyer then asked for more time to consult with his client. During court proceedings, Pillay stared at the floor.           He is believed to have killed Jane, Denisha and Rackelle Govindasamy in their Phoenix home in September. The women's bodies were found by Sagren Govindasamy, Jane's husband and father to Denisha and Rackelle. The Mercury
