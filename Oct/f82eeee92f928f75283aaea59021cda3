Durban - eThekwini Deputy mayor Fawzia Peer was among those shedding light on the topic of teenage suicide in Phoenix on Sunday. Peer was a guest speaker at the non-profit group, Angels Vent, which was recently founded after 15 teenagers in Phoenix ended their lives in 2018 alone. "One should never underestimate the power of intervention; we must do everything we can to prevent the number of suicides from escalating. We cannot lose another life," said Peer to a packed auditorium in Palmview, Phoenix. Peer encouraged parents to have open communication lines with their children. “No child chooses to be depressed and most parents become too busy and forget their children. But I’m saying to you today, find the time, find the time to sit and talk to your children, they need your love and attention.” To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

Her mother Michelle Reddy spoke about the last moments before Kaylene took her life: "The day before (the incident) she did not go to school, she was at home. What drove her to do it, we do not fully understand." Mervyn Reddy together with former radio personality CJ Benjamin hosted the day event. Reddy said he has since taken on the challenge to educate and uplift the community by spreading the message of hope and love. Benjamin highlighted the need to spread the message of hope and light to every child facing a sense of hopelessness and despair. “The reason we are here today is to make sure that it is not your child, not your brother or your sister.” To read more about this, get your copy of POST this Wednesday.
