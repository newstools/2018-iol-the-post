Durban - An Operation Fiela initiative carried out in Greenwood Park last night led to the arrests of four men. Offices were conducting operations in Briardene and surrounding areas when they heard gunshots and saw a vehicle speeding off. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said officers chased after the vehicle and managed to get the driver to stop the car in Chris Hani (North Coast) Road. “One of the suspect pulled out a firearm and attempted to shoot a police officer. The police officer managed to disarm the suspect and restrain him. A 9mm pistol with six rounds of ammunition, eight cellphones and a vehicle were seized from the suspects. The four men aged between 21 and 27, were arrested for armed robbery, attempted murder, possession of an unlicensed firearm and possession of suspected stolen property,” he said. Zwane said officers had taken the men to the police station when a man walked in an claimed that he had been robbed by the same men. “He said another person was also robbed and shot. The victim was taken to hospital for medical attention,” he said. The men will also be profiled to establish if they are linked to any other cases reported at the Greenwood Park police station. The suspects will appear in the Durban Magistrates Court soon. Daily News
