Durban - A man who allegedly stabbed a street trader over the sale of a cigarette was arrested. Andreas Mathios, Blue Security community and media liaison officer, said the incident took place on Friday on Lighthouse Road in Bluff. Mathios said the suspect had apparently approached a street trader and allegedly demanded a cigarette from her without having the money to pay for it. "When she refused to give him a cigarette an argument broke out between them. The suspect ran away only to return with a broken bottle neck which he used to stab the street trader in the chest before fleeing the scene." Mathios said armed response officer was called to the scene and he gave chase and arrested the suspect in Garmouth Road. He said the victim was treated at the scene by staff from Bluff Medical Centre before being transported to King Edward Hospital for further medical attention. "The suspect was handed over to Brighton Beach SAPS at the scene,” Mathios said. POST
