Durban - Crimen injuria accused Kessie Nair's attorney said they planned to appeal the bail decision on Wednesday morning. Nair, who is accused of calling President Cyril Ramaphosa the k-word was denied bail in the Verulam Magistrate's Court. His attorney Chris Gounden said they planned to take the matter on appeal. "There is no basis for a refusal of bail on a trivial matter like crimen injuria." At the last court appearance, Gounden argued that the State was on a witch hunt to persecute Nair and “he is being persecuted because he's Indian”. He said that Nair's family were upset following the decision. "In addition, my client spent his 60th birthday behind bars and he only has 29 percent of his heart functioning, and is on a donor list." Nair will be admitted to Fort Napier in April where he will undergo a mental evaluation. The matter was adjourned for October 24. Daily News
