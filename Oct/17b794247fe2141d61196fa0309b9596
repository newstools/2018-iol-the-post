Durban - MATH-whizz kids Dante Lazarus and Keshalya Singh have raised the South African flag high at the annual Global Association of Japanese Soroban and Mental Arithmetic(GAJSMA) World Numeracy competition, walking away with the titles super champion and champion, respectively. Dante and Keshalya, both 8, competed against more than 270 children, who also attend abacus-based maths tuition, for the coveted titles.Some of the competing countries included India, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. Dante, of Hillary, won first place in the Kyu(level) 9 category, while Keshalya, of Malvern, came second in Kyu 10 category. The Grade 3 pupils at Parkside Primary School attend additional maths tuition with Smart Mental Arithmetic, which tutors them to calculate maths sums mentally and using an abacus. This includes addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of numbers ranging from single-digit operations to adding numbers in the trillions. Keshalya’s father, Kelvin, said the competition was based on high speed and accurate calculations within a specified time limit. "The competition comprised two sections - calculating sums using the abacus with a six-minute limit and anzan (mental maths) with a two-minute limit to complete questions. "It was Keshalya's first competitive experience on a large scale and she did exceptionally well. We are proud of her as she had only started tuition a year ago and has excelled. We only hope that next year she will continue to fly the South African flag high," he said. Dante's mother, Tracy, added that she was proud of Dante, who obtained a 100 percent pass in both the sections. "He has remained humble and is proud of his achievement. This journey has taught Danté a life lesson that great achievements are possible through hard work and perseverance." They were also selected to compete at the GAJSMA World Numeracy Competition 2019 in Dubai. POST
