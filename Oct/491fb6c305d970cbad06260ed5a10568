Durban - Three men who stand accused of murdering former Southlands Secondary School principal, Gona Pillay in September 2017, will stand trial next year. The date for the trial was set at the Durban High Court where the men appeared today. Lungani Basil Underhill, 25, from Folweni; his cousin Sibonelo Braveman Underhill, 25, from eManzimtoti; and Fredboy Msomi, 30, from Umbumbulu, face charges of murder, attempted murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances. The men are believed to have entered the couple's home in Silverglen in September last year, pretending to be interested as the house was for sale. At the time of the incident, Underhill was in the employ of Pam Golding Properties. Pillay was strangled to death and her husband was assaulted during the horrific attack. During today's court proceedings, it was heard that the trio viewed the couple's home thereafter producing a knife and assaulted the couple before stealing their television and money. Daily News
