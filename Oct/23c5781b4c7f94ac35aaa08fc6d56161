Durban- The charges against the three men who were allegedly involved in a rock-throwing incident in December that led to the death of two siblings were withdrawn. According to a well-placed source, the charges against mechanic Selvan Govender, 46, his son Nathan Govender, 27, and employee Qiniso Bhekithemba Gumbi, 20, were withdrawn on Friday after it emerged witnesses had made false statements. The men’s attorney, Rajendra Nathalal, said: “While we accept this decision with mixed feelings, those endless months and days in custody can never be erased. The criminal justice system has failed them." During their bail application, the court heard that Selvan lived with his wife and children on a farm in Tongaat. Gumbi’s statement revealed that he was an assistant at Selvans motor mechanic business and had previous convictions relating to dangerous weapons. Nathan denied his involvement in the incident. The men were charged with the murder of Amina Haffajee, 16, and her brother, Abdul Rahim, 7 who were passengers in white Toyota Corolla. The siblings suffered fatal injuries after a rock was thrown off a bridge on the N2 near Tongaat. The youngsters died enroute to hospital. POST
