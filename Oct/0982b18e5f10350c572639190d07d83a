Durban - For breast cancer awareness month Durban lingerie boutique Satin Candy are affording all their customers the opportunity to have complimentary breast examinations in store. Satin Candy founder, Sandra Thomas, said they were excited to educate women about the risk of breast cancer, which affects 1 in 27 women in SA. “The majority of women who come into our stores for the first time often wear the wrong size bra. "Many of them don’t know the health risks that are caused by wearing the incorrectly sized bra. These health risks could even lead to breast cancer," said Thomas. She said for every in-store purchase, they would donate R50 towards the Pink Drive as well. The Pink Drive KZN Administrator, Janice Benecke, believes the partnership with Satin Candy will go a long way to growing awareness. “Our partnership with one of Durban’s’ leading bra boutiques can definitely help us to extend our reach and accomplish our mission of helping women through early detection, education and support services,” she said. The Pink Drive team will be doing breast examinations at Satin Candy’s Kloof branch on Tuesday, October 16 and at the Windermere branch on Friday, October 19, from 10 am until 2 pm. Daily News
