Durban - A security guard is fighting for his life after he was shot and dumped in a cemetery near Molweni on Monday night. The man was discovered by his colleagues on Tuesday. According to Garrith Jamieson of Rescue Care Paramedics, medics arrived on scene just before 1 pm on Tuesday and found the man seriously injured. He had been down an embankment. “He had sustained a gunshot wound to his upper body and was in a serious condition. Advanced Life Support Paramedics worked to stabilise him down the bank before carrying the man to an awaiting ambulance," said Jamieson. He said due to the severity of the man's injuries they chose to fly the patient to a specialist facility for the urgent care he required." The IPSS Black Eagle Aeromedical Helicopter was used to airlift the patient to a hospital. Jamieson said events leading up to the incident to SAPS investigations. POST
