Durban - The City announced that plans were in the pipeline to remove illegal billboards across the City. This announcement was made during the Economic Development and Planning Committee meeting last week. According to  Mandla Nsele, eThekwini Municipality’s Acting Head of Communications, the Municipality recently awarded a tender to a service provider to remove large free-standing illegal billboards within eThekwini. "This three-year contract is a result of illegal signs that have mushroomed at public and privately owned property without approval by the municipality." Musa Mbhele, Head of Development Planning, Environmental and Management Unit, said these illegal billboards have a very negative impact in the city’s endeavour to attract tourists and businesses. “It is for this reason that we have taken this decision to clamp down on illegal billboards to ensure that outdoor advertising is managed properly to create tidy and safe City,” said Mbhele. The City said they were by-laws in place. POST
