Durban - KZN sisters Rox Green and Spoon Green walked away with R1 million after winning My Kitchen Rules South Africa. The sisters who live in Winterton, clinched the title after beating newly engaged couple Pashi Reddy and Kamisha Naidoo, also from KZN. Both teams were set the task of creating a gourmet five-course meal -  an appetiser, a soup, a pasta dish, a main meal and a dessert. Adding to the pressure of five courses, they were required to prepare 20 plates of each course for the grand finale – 100 plates in all. The farm sisters scored a total of 47 out of 60 points, beating Kim and Pashi by eight points. Rox and Spoen were low-key contenders for the entire competition, and none of their fellow competitors would have expected to see them in the finale. In the semi - finals Pashi Reddy proposed to his girlfriend of five years, Kamisha Naidoo. The couple plan to open their own restaurant one day. Daily News
