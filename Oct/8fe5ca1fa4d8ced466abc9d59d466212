Instead, they are counting their losses after their home was gutted by a fire on Saturday, leaving them homeless. The family, who lost most of their belongings, are unsure how the fire started and are awaiting a report from the fire department. Division commander Owen Singh said they suspected the fire had started in the lounge but was unclear how it began. Roshantin Govender, 28, who found his identity document in the rubble, said: “All that remains is little crumbled pieces of what used to be our furniture.” He said he went to a friend’s home on Saturday morning and that his dad, 55, went to work and his mother, 50, left to go to the shop. Neighbours then called to inform them that their house was on fire. “Our neighbours tried to douse the fire with water but everything happened so quickly,” said Roshantin. “My parents spent years renovating our home and their hard work went up in flames. I cannot forget seeing my mother, who is a lupus patient, rolling on the floor in shock and in tears.” Roshantin is living with a friend, and his parents with extended family, until they can sort out their outbuilding, which was saved from the fire, and move in there. “The house is not insured and there is a lot that needs to be done.” In the spirit of ubuntu, he said, neighbours and the community were rallying to help them rebuild their lives.
