Durban - Mohammed Ebrahim, the 43-year-old man accused of kidnapping Sydenham boy, Miguel Louw, is a free man - for now. Ebrahim was spotted at a local butchery at the weekend, after paying his bail last week. A member of the Louw family, told the Daily News that Ebrahim had been seen at the butchery in Asherville on Saturday morning. "We were told that his bail was paid on Tuesday," the relative said. According to TimesLive, Ebrahim's attorney, confirmed that his client was released from Westville Prison. Ebrahim was granted R2500 bail last month but his family could not come up with the money at the time and he remained in custody. HeÂ was arrested less than a week following Miguel's disappearance in July this year. After an extensive search, Miguel's decomposed body was found in a shallow grave in Phoenix last month. Officers from a private security company made the gruesome discovery while they were chasing suspects who had committed an armed robbery at a local shop. The young boy's funeral was held last month and his body cremated. Ebrahim is due back in court on October 17. Daily News
