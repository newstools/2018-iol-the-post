Durban - Four rifles, a pistol, a shotgun and ammunition were recovered during a crime intelligence operation conducted by police in Mvoti, northern KwaZulu-Natal at the weekend. Provincial police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said two men were also arrested. Gwala said on Friday,  Pietermaritzburg Tactical Response Team and Dalton police officers swooped on two homesteads. “One suspect was found in possession of a pistol and a rifle as well as ammunition. The second suspect was found at another homestead with three rifles and ammunition,” she said. Gwala said the men, aged 36 and 46, will appear in the New Hanover Magistrate’s Court today on charges of illegal possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition.
