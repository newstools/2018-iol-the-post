Durban - A man who allegedly committed two murders more than a decade ago was arrested by police this week. KZN police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said it was the perseverance of police officers that led to the breakthrough. The 42-year-old suspect was arrested in Meadowlands, Zone Nine in Gauteng and is expected to make his first appearance in the New Hanover Magistrate's Court on Thursday. He faces two counts of murder. According to Zwane the incident took place on December 5, 2007. It is alleged that the victims Thembinkosi Ngubane, 25, and Scelo Mncube, 23, were at their home at Mollisima Road in Dalton when they were approached by the suspect. "It is alleged that the suspect demanded to know the whereabouts of his girlfriend and an argument ensued. The suspect shot and killed both men and fled on foot." Zwane said this week police received intelligence which led to the arrest. DAILY NEWS
