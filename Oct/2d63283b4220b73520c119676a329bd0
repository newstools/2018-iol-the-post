Durban - Hundreds of residents wanting to cancel their contracts with Telkom have had to wait after the service provider admitted to experiencing problems with their cancellation systems. According to MyBroadband, the problem has been going on for a few months, affecting customers using fibre, ADSL and LTE. Some residents have said they are waiting as long as six months to have their product services cancelled and are still being billed while the cancellation is being processed. MyBroadband said others have been trying to cancel their services from last year. MyBroadband said since these issues began surfacing, Telkom acknowledged that it was experiencing some issues with its cancellation systems. It said it was working to fix the problems with its cancellation system, but these issues seem to remain just as prevalent as they did months ago, judging by the number of complaints received by MyBroadband. The company advised that customers who were unable to cancel their packages should contact the national customer care channel via the following methods: Email – natcc@telkom.co.za Call centre – 012 311 2473 Daily News
