Durban - A Pakistani national who was arrested by the Hawks for allegedly conspiring to kidnap the children of wealthy businessmen appeared in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate's Court. Asif Mohammed, 47, who has been living in South Africa since 1997,  applied for bail on Monday. Through his defence attorney, Mohammed said he intended pleading not guilty. The matter was adjourned for Friday for a decision on the bail application. Mohammed was arrested by members of the Hawks and Crime Intelligence on September 28. According to Hawks spokesperson, Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi, the suspect was arrested after it transpired that he was allegedly planning to kidnap high profile business people and their children in the Pietermaritzburg area. "Several undercover operations were conducted where the suspect allegedly gave a detailed description of his first target, the safe house where the victim would be held; as well as other electronic tools to be utilised during and after the alleged kidnapping," said Mulaudzi. In a written affidavit presented to the court, Mohammed said that he was only able to afford a bail amount of R15 000. He said he operated a business and had two minor children. POST
