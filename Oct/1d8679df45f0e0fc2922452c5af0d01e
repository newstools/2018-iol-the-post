Durban - Two people convicted for the 2016 murder of Lenasia pharmacy student Jaishika Amtha appeared briefly in the Palmridge High Court on Wednesday for pre-sentence reports. Alexis Mare, 32,  and Sharon du Preez, 45, were recently found guilty of shooting the pharmacy student twice in her head. The duo pleaded not guilty to murder and told the court that they had assisted Amtha to commit suicide. Amtha, 23, was found bound and gagged in her Lenasia home on March 17, 2016. She had two gunshot wounds to her head. It her was mother who made the gruesome discovery when she returned home from a religious service. Mare and du Preez told the court that they had assisted Amtha to commit suicide as she was suffering from cancer and did not want her family to find out. However the State presented evidence that Amtha was in good health. The court heard that Amtha had met the accused through OLX, where she had posted a few items like a camera, cellphone, and tv for sale online. A month after her death, in April 2016, members of the Provincial task team comprising Warrant officer Rajan Govender, Rajen Nagessar and Pravad Maharaj arrested the duo while working on another case in Johannesburg. The duo have remained behind bars since their arrest. The accused, who were found in possession of Amtha's items, told the court that she had given them the items in return for helping her end her life. The matter was adjourned for November 2 for sentencing. Daily News
