Durban - Family and friends of the 19 suspects accused of a spate of bombings in and around Durban stood outside the Verulam Family Court on Monday, many with tears in their eyes. The suspects are also believed to be linked to the attack on the Imam Hussein Mosque in Verulam where Abbas Essop was killed in May. They face charges of murder, attempted murder, extortion, kidnapping, contravention of the Explosive Act and arson. Court proceedings were held in-camera, media and family were not allowed in court because of sensitive evidence. Simphiwe Mhlongo, Hawks KZN spokesperson, said between March and August this year, Durban and surrounding areas were plagued with several incidents of placing and detonating of these devices including widespread hoax callers. "The 19 suspects were arrested last week Friday in and around Durban by an integrated team involving the Hawks (Crimes Against the State), Crime Intelligence, the Forensic Unit, the National Prosecuting Authority including other departments from the justice cluster." He said during the arrest various items were confiscated including a readymade incendiary device. "Members also managed to rescue a victim who was found chained and malnourished inside a dungeon in one of the houses.Â  The victim is under police protection in one of the hospitals in the Kwazulu Natal province."
