Herpetologist Ryan Soobrayan had plans to tie the knot with his fiancé Jacquelyn Sewcharan in 2019. The venue for their wedding had been booked and they were in the process of finalising other details for their big day. However, last Wednesday, the 26-year-old Soobrayan, a farm manager at African Reptiles and Venom in Gauteng, was bitten by the venomous snake. He was rushed to hospital and spent three days in a coma. He died on Saturday, the day before his 27th birthday. In a statement, African Reptiles and Venom said Soobrayan had suffered severe anaphylactic reaction from the venom, which led to his death. His uncle, Eugene Soobrayan, said his nephew was formerly from Northcroft and moved to Midrand 17 years ago. “Since he was a child, Ryan had a fascination with reptiles. It started off with dinosaurs and when he got to his teens he developed an interest in snakes. His field of study did not come as a surprise to us.” Eugene said his nephew imported and exported exotic snakes and had a collection of over 130 reptiles. “Ryan had proposed to Jacquelyn earlier this year. He was excited about their wedding. They booked a venue in Midrand and were finalising other details. Jacquelyn has been left devastated by his death.” Snake conservationist, Nick Evans, said it usually took a few hours for someone to die from a black mamba bite, depending on the severity. “It is important to get to a hospital as soon as possible in order to be given the anti-venom. A black mamba bite contains neurotoxic venom. “The venom affects the nervous system and almost immediately your body begins to shut down.” Evans explained that the person would have difficulty breathing, nausea, dizziness and slurred speech. “Black mamba’s are generally very shy snakes but if they feel threatened or intimidated they will bite. If this type of snake is found in your home or yard it is always better to keep your distance and call a professional for help.” POST
