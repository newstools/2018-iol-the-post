Durban - The Chief of the South African National Defence Force, General Solly Shoke, has commended SANDF members for the recovery of four stolen vehicles that were heading towards the Mozambique border on Friday night. General Shoke said the level of combat readiness, discipline and bravery displayed by the deployed SANDF troops along the South Africa borderlines with neighbouring countries, seeks to ensure that the South African citizens are and feel safe. He said nine South African Infantry Battalion (Bravo Company) deployed at Macadamia Operational Base under the command of Major Malebo Manganye, received a call from Tracker SA about possible stolen vehicles that were headed towards the South Africa / Mozambique borderline on September 28 at about 21:45pm. "Maj Manganye activated the reaction force and they proceeded towards the possible illegal border-crossing point used by vehicle smugglers into Mozambique. On arrival at the illegal border-crossing point, the troops managed to recover two vehicles (a 2016 FordRanger valued at R200 000 and a Toyota Hilux 2013 model valued at R 350 000). "At approximately 05h45 on October 1, a patrolling platoon from the same Battalion noticed unusual vehicle movement from an observation post. "Two members from the observation post went to investigate the movement and found six vehicles near the South Africa / Mozambique borderline. Two vehicles managed to flee and illegally crossed into Mozambique. The two SANDF members managed to stop the remaining four vehicles from illegally crossing into Mozambique." General Shoke said three of the four drivers fled on foot and illegally crossed into Mozambique. "One driver was apprehended by the troops at the scene and the four vehicles were handed over to the Komatipoort South African Police Services (SAPS) for further investigation." Daily News
