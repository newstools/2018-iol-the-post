Durban - The Nair family was previously advised that their son was not well and needed psychiatric treatment. This is according to Krishnan Nair, who this morning gave evidence against his brother, Kessie, in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court. According to Nair, at the time of Kessie’s release from jail in 2009, their parents were informed that their son needed treatment. Nair said, his brother disputed his mental state. He had been convicted and sentenced following a fraud case against him. Kessie is back in court for his formal bail application after he was arrested for calling President Cyril Ramaphosa the K-word.      The state is claiming Nair is mentally unstable however the defense is claiming Nair is sane and was sane when he called Pres Ramaphosa the K word #KessieNair @TheMercurySA  — Kailene Pillay (@kailenepillay) 
 October 1, 2018  The almost two-week old video went viral on social media and sparked outrage from the community. At Kessie’s court appearance last week, his family and a District Surgeon handed in affidavits stating that the former councillor was mentally unwell. Nair said it was not a proud moment for him as he stood in the dock and testified against his brother. "As a family, we are saying that he does need medical attention. His state was clearly visible in the video that was posted that it certainly does not come from a person with a sane mind," he said.
