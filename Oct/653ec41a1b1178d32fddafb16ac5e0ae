A new motor licencing office is set to open in KZN on Friday. Durban - The KZN Department of Transport announced that MEC Mxolisi Kaunda will officially open the Provincial Regulatory Entity (PRE) and Motor Licenses service offices in Mbazwana in the Elephant Coast. According to department spokesperson, Kwanele Ncalane, the unit was previously known as the Public Transport Board, with offices centrally placed in Pietermaritzburg. "This practically meant that taxi and bus operators from all corners of the province had to travel long distances to submit applications. "This created many challenges which resulted in delays in the processing of permit and uncollected operating licenses amongst other things." Ncalane said the transport department hence deemed it fit to decentralize these services to ensure efficiency and that they are closer to operators. "This process resulted in the opening of other PRE offices across the province in areas such as Port Shepstone, Ladysmith and Empangeni. The new Mbazwana offices will service operators from Umhlabuyalingana, Jozini, Mkhuze, Ngwavuma and surrounding areas." POST
