She wrote: “The **** is out of jail ... I have to live with the pain and suffering and the heartache and knowing that I will never be able to hold my child again and all these thoughts in my mind of what my child went through ... it’s just not fair. “My boy was only 9 years old he did not even get a chance to live his life. My angel is gone ....” Police could not confirm that Mohamed Vahed Ebrahim had been released on bail last week. However his attorney, Chris Gounden, said his client had been released. “I’m not sure on which day he was released but he came to my office last week and unfortunately I was not in at that time.” Ebrahim was the last person seen with the Grade 4, Rippon Road Primary School pupil in July. Miguel’s body was found last month in a shallow grave in Longberry Drive, Phoenix, metres away from the 43-year-old accused’s home. The family’s spokesperson, Vasthi Williams, said Louw acted in frustration and fear. “There is an ongoing investigation and this guy is walking free. Raylene feels as though he is laughing in their faces, as though he is an untouchable. It’s hard for her as a mom. Her son was taken away. She searched for him. We must understand the emotions from the mother’s point.” The case is due back in court later this month. POST
