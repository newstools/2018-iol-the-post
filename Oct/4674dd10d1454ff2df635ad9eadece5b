Durban - Looking to a career choice? Then head down to The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) for their mechanical engineering open day on Friday. Innovative engineering projects of the final year students will be showcased. Some of the unique projects on display will include the design of an archery device for use by quadriplegic athletes, a device that creates the illusion of fruit growing on trees, and an electric transporter, powered by solar energy, the university said in a statement this week. Assessment of the projects is structured in accordance with the Engineering outcomes required by the Engineering Council of South Africa (ECSA). Academic Leader for Mechanical Engineering at UKZN, Professor Glen Bright, said the focus of the Open Day is to highlight the hard work and technical achievements of the final-year students. “We want the public to experience and interact with these engineering projects,” said Professor Bright. In addition, some previous-year design projects will be on display, with staff and students on hand to take the public for a ride on the UKZN pedal bus, electric trikes and the rally car simulator. There will also be technology demonstrations throughout the day, including the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a mobile robotic display. The open day begins at 12 pm and will take place at the Unit School of Engineering Building at Howard Campus. POST
