Durban - Police have confirmed that a 36-year-old man was arrested following a raid at Sydenham Heights at the weekend. On Saturday afternoon, the area around Sydenham Heights was closed off to traffic as police swept the blocks of flats for drugs and other illegal items. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said the man was charged for being in possession of drugs. He is due to appear in court soon, Zwane added. The raid comes after a spate of shootings at the flats recently. It is believed that the shootings are a result of ongoing turf wars between rival gangs. The Sunday Tribune reported that residents were caught in the middle of the battle. Last week, residents in Butcher Road were left shaken after a brazen drive-by shooting. Meanwhile, ward councillor, Chris Pappas, said since December 2017 the situation has drastically deteriorated. “A turf war has erupted between two groups dealing in drugs with members from Cape Town being called in to the fight. Police were made aware of the situation in December when the first violent incidents took place,” he said. Pappas said they need the community to come forward with information that can assist police in their investigations. He said the majority of people living in the affected areas are law abiding, tax paying citizens who just want a safe place to live. Daily News
