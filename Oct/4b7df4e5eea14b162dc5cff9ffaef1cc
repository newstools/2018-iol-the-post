Durban - COMEDIENNE, television host and actress Tumi Morake has released her book, And Then Mama Said. While the book officially hit shelves today, it gives a behind the scenes perspective of the star. Morake, who has gets frank about the race row at Jacaranda FM, the Jaguar car incident and about body shaming, has dominated the mostly male space of stand-up comedy for years. “This isn’t my biography, but a collection of memories from my life.  I have shared some of the things that have made me resilient and shaped the persona of Tumi Morake. "I have often been asked to share my story and I thought what better way than by honouring the woman who made me who I am, my mother,” she said. Throughout her story, she carries the voice of her mother, and with it the indispensable life lessons that made her who she is today. “It took me a long time to figure out how to tell this story, whether I should be comedic as would be expected or just share my honest perspective. "I looked back at how often my cousins and I would revert back to what my mother said growing up; and I decided then to let that voice that is with me all the time to guide me in my book.” The book is published through Penguin Random House and is available at Exclusive Books, Bargain Books, Loot, Takealot and Reader’s Warehouse.
