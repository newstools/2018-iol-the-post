Durban -  A Phoenix father who pleaded guilty to strangling and killing his 7-year-old son was sentenced to 25 years in the Durban High Court on Wednesday. In April 2017 Pravin Kubair, 30, had taken his son, Rinaldo Elijah to a local park where he strangled the boy using a rope. In his plea statement Kubair said he had also intended to kill his 4-year-old daughter but the child had fallen asleep. He said his daughter did not witness her brother’s death. Kubair further stated in his plea that the reason he had killed his son was to end the pain of seeing his family torn apart. Kubair and his wife were estranged following a tumultuous relationship. Before taking the children to the park, Kubair had also sent a Whatsapp message to his wife saying, “I am taking what’s mine”. In aggravation of sentencing State Advocate Denardo MacDonald argued that Kubair had killed his son to punish his wife. “To punish his wife, he took away from her what every mother holds most valuable...her children." "The rehabilitation that he needs can be found in prison. The accused does not deserve to be in our society. His sentence (life) should also serve as a deterrent,” said MacDonald. POST
