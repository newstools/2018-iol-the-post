Contact Warrant Officer Rajen Naidoo on 031 405 7229 Durban - Bayview Police are trying to track the owners of six flat-screen televisions to hand over their property to them. Earlier in the month, the Bayview Crime Prevention members arrested a 38-year-old man for being in possession of property suspected to be stolen. Police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said while the man was remanded in custody, the station is sitting with the six flat-screen TVs. She advised victims of house robberies to contact the station. â€œThe Bayview Police are looking for any person who had a television stolen recently during a home invasion." People are urged to contact Warrant Officer Rajen Naidoo on 031 405 7229 or email on NaidooRajendran@saps.gov.za if they think any of the televisions belong to them. "However you must provide proof." A police source said that many people have come through but their description did not match any of the six televisions. POST
