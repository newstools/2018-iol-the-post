Durban - A man appeared in the Krugersdorp Magistrate's Court on Monday following the death of a Lenasia man at a drug rehabilitation centre in October. Father of three, Muhammed Shaik, 40, died on October 14, two weeks after being admitted to the Magaliesburg Health Centre - a division of the Crescent of Hope South Africa organisation - on September 28. His family claim he died after being brutally assaulted and tied to a pole whilst at a drug rehabilitation centre. On Friday Mohammed Khan, 37, was arrested. He appeared in court on Monday and faces charges of murder. Shaik was in the intensive care unit at a hospital when he died. The Centre has since been closed after it was found to be operating illegally. Khan who is believed to be an employee at the rehab centre was remanded in police custody until his bail application next week. POST
