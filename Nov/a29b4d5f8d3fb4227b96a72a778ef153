Durban- Tourists visiting Durban during the festive season are in for a treat as the eThekwini Municipality will officially launch the multi-million rand state-of-the-art Riksha buses this week. The launch is set to take place at the Suncoast Sundeck-Promenade on November 7, at 9am. eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede, said under her leadership she wants to see Durban increasing its market share of tourists dramatically in all seasons of the year. Tourism is a major contributor in the city’s economy and with summer vacations looming on the horizon, the Municipality is pulling all the stops to look after the welfare of all its tourists. “We are a city hard at work. Tourists that come to our city should automatically be our ambassador when they are gone back home. We will only do that by ensuring that we unceasingly meet their needs. "Hopping on the Ricksha Bus is the most convenient way for them to explore the City’s tourism offerings where one is able to sightsee scenic overviews of a range of Durban’s major attractions, while learning about the City’s history, its people and their heritage, cultural diversity and many more,” said Gumede. She added: " It is going to be an experience that will forever be engraved in the minds of many of our tourists we are very excited." POST
