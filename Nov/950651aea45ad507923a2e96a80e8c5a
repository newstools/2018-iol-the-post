Durban - One person has been killed and 38 others injured on Thursday afternoon when a bus rolled on the N3 near the Nottingham Road in Pietermaritzburg. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said paramedics, along with several other services, arrived on the scene to find the wrecked bus on the side of the highway. "Several people had already climbed out of the bus and were found walking around on the scene. "On closer inspection, paramedics found that one patient, a woman, had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for her and he was declared dead." Meiring said out of 48 patients assessed one was in a critical condition. "Other sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate." Meiring said the patients were treated for their injuries and the critically injured provided with advanced life support interventions before they were transported to various hospitals for further treatment. SAPS were on scene. Daily News
