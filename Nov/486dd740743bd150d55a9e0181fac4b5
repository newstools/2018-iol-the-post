Durban - Indictments in the murder of 9-year-old Sadia Sukhraj were served in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Sibonelo Mkhize, 35, faces charges of murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances. Sadia was killed in May following a botched hijacking. Mkhize was ordered to appear in the Durban High Court on November 19. The State intends calling 33 witnesses. The State alleges that Sadia was killed outside her grandparents Shallcross home in May during a botched hijacking. She had been with her father Shailendra Sukhraj when they came under attack. Sadia was taken with the hijackers when shots were fired. She died at the scene. Another suspect was also killed Siyabonga Bulose during the shootout. Mkhize was arrested at the scene. He will remain at the Westville Prison as an awaiting trial prisoner. A day after little Sadia Sukhraj was laid to rest after an emotional send-off, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has confirmed that the off-duty police officer who was involved in the shooting, while apparently trying to foil a hijacking in Shallcross, has been cleared of firing the fatal bullet that ended the 9-year-old's life.
