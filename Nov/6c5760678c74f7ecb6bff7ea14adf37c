Genevieve Amichand, and her co- accused, Phoenix brothers, Roshan and Rakesh Harilall, were arrested following the alleged thefts in February 2016 and December 2016. Roshan Harilall is a diamond card holder at the casino which means he spends an average of R5 million a year at the casino. His brother Rakesh is a gold card holder and has to spend in the region of R3.5 million to R4 million a year to maintain his status. The accused are being represented by attorney Chris Gounden. All three were initially charged with R3.7 million fraud when they were arrested last year. However, the matter was not placed on the court roll at the time. The charges were reinstated in June this year. Rakesh Harilallâ€™s wife Sunisha Harry was also arrested in June and released on R1 000 bail. The three others are out on a warning and were summoned to court. The fraud amount was decreased from R3.7 million to R487 000. The State alleges Amichand had spun the wheel on the roulette table slowly, resulting in an error. Instead of declaring the error and re-spinning, she allegedly announced the error number as a win. All four are believed to have acted in common purpose and have pleaded not guilty. Amichand was dismissed by Sibaya Casino. She took the matter to the CCMA. The matter is proceeding. POST
