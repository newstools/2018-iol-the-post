Durban - The decision by the Department of Basic Education to move the supplementary exams to June is to allow pupils ample time to study. The supplementary exams are usually written by pupils who are unable or do not pass National Senior Certificate examinations. The Department of Education said this would apply nationally. Kwazi Mthethwa spokesperson for the KZN Education Department said the pupils generally begin their supplementary exams in mid- February. "By having the exam later, we are giving pupils enough time to study and take whatever extra lessons they require in order to get a better mark." In 2017, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga, together with education MEC’s and Heads of Department across all provinces made the decision to do away with the supplementary exam. In a circular released by the department, it reads: "We have noted that on average around 40 000 learners who enrol for supplementary examinations every year do not turn up to write the examinations, “This results in massive wasteful expenditure. By having these examinations in June, there will be adequate time for revision and learners can make use of the comprehensive support material provided through the Second Chance Matric Support Programme. "This will also allow learners the opportunity to rewrite as many subjects as they want as opposed to the current two subjects allowed.” In 2018, learners who wrote the supplementary exam and obtained the NSC increased from 401 435 to 411 523, an increase of 10 088 candidates.
