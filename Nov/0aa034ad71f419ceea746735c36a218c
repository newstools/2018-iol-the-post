Durban - The SABC's probe into alleged sexual harassment in the workplace revealed that most of the complaints lodged had come from radio. The findings of the inquiry were released on Tuesday via a live press briefing from the SABC offices in Gauteng. Commissioner Barbara Watson said the Western Cape was the "only region" where not even a whisper was heard. Watson said the independent commission found there was a demand for sexual favours from senior to junior employees and that this had led to a "toxic work environment". As a result, the complainants, she added, had resigned. Watson explained that the findings were not part of a judiciary inquiry. It was an internal commission set up with the approval and support of the (SABC) board. She said most of the complaints had come from KZN and mentioned media reports on incidents alleged to have happened at Lotus FM. The commission had to move to KZN to hold hearings, said Watson, while all others were held at their offices in Johannesburg. Looking at the findings of the "special favours", a fellow commissioner and the former chairman of the Commission for Gender Equality, Mfena Shozi, said two issues had been raised. "I give you a job, you give me sex . . . or money." He said those who had been wrongfully employed, were "afraid to come forward because if found . . . he or she may be demoted or fired. "That's why it was difficult to investigate the issue of special favours" Shozi added that there were no complaints from men being sexually harassed; all the complainants were women. POST
