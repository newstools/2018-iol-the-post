Durban - AN alleged Uber driver - who was wanted for murder - was involved in a high speed chase with police on Thursday. The alleged Uber driver's car ended up crashing into another on the M13 highway in Pinetown, with his car rolling after the crash. The accident caused traffic congestion for several hours in the area. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the police had been pursuit of the motorist who failed to stop when he was flagged by police. “Police were patrolling the area when they tried to flag down the suspect. He drew a firearm and shot at the police who retaliated causing the car to crash into another vehicle before overturning,” Zwane said. Zwane said the suspect tried to flee the scene on foot but a police dog caught up with him. “It is alleged the man was wanted for murder,” Zwane said. He said the Shongweni K9 unit were involved in the arrest. A local Pinetown police spokesperson, Captain Bongumusa Manqele, told the Highway Mail that the man in pursuit was an Uber driver. “It is alleged the man was wanted for a murder which took place in Hillcrest in May. The suspect started shooting at the police and police retaliated,” he said. Spokespersons for Uber were approached for comment on Thursday and said they could not confirm as they were still launching an investigation into the matter. nkululeko.nene@inl.co.za Sunday Tribune
