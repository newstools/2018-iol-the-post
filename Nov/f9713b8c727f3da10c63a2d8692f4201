Durban - Colin Pillay, the man accused of brutally murdering a Phoenix mother and her two daughters, will spend Christmas behind bars. Pillay abandoned his bail application for the second time when he appeared in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. His attorney Chris Gouden did not indicate to court reasons his client did not apply for bail. Jane Govindsamy, 45, an employee at a logistics company and her daughters Denisha, 22, and Rackelle, 16, a Grade 11 pupil at Rydal Park Secondary, were found dead in their Longcroft Phoenix home on September 21. Pillay, 45, a tow truck driver faces charges of three counts of premeditated murder and one of robbery with aggravating circumstances. The matter was adjourned to January for further investigations. Pastor Dan Marshall, of the Phoenix Ministers Fraternal, and a friend of the accused’s family, told POST Newspaper that he had known Pillay as a “very godly man” who sang gospel songs during a church roadshow and had asked when the next one was taking place.
