Durban - A police officer is facing two counts of murder after he shot his estranged wife and her brother inside the O Regional Court on Monday. The man allegedly entered the courtroom after showing guards his identification card. This, investigators believe, is how he managed to enter the courtroom with his state-issued firearm. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said at 11am the court adjourned. “Just before court was about to start, the man fired shots. Two people died at the scene. The suspect turned the gun on himself. He did not die and was rushed to hospital for medical attention,” Mbele said.
