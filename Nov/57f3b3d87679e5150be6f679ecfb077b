Durban - The two men accused of murdering Wentworth mother Bianca Parsons appeared briefly in the Durban High Court this week and their case was adjourned to December 3. Darryl Morrison, 33, and Christopher Houston, 26, have been charged with murder. They remain in police custody. Their bail application in May was denied. This was their first appearance in the high court. The men were arrested following the murder of Parsons who was killed on February 26 while at the Engine garage in Wentworth. Parsons had been seated in the car with her three-year-old child when the shooting occurred. She died at the scene. The men were arrested after CCTV camera footage allegedly linked them to the crime. The accused indicated that they did not have an attorney and had requested attorney Ridewaan Sayed. They told the court that Sayed was not available on Monday. The Daily News reported that Morrison who lives in Wentworth told the Durban Magistrate's Court that he was sorry. He said that he had mistaken Parsons for another woman when the trigger was pulled.
