Durban - Families, wanting to know about the progress of autopsies of their loved ones, are requested to contact the KwaZulu-Natal Health Provincial Operations Centre on their toll-free contact number. The request comes after a strike by staff at the Fort Napier Medico-Legal Mortuaries. KZN Department of Health MEC, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, said they acknowledges the unfortunate disruptions to normal service delivery as a result of the actions of Forensic Pathology Services staff. "The department continues to engage with organised labour regarding the labour relations issues raised, and has committed to make efforts to speedily resolve some of them at provincial level. These include the supply of equipment and repair of air conditioners. However, some of the issues raised are being dealt with at national level," Dhlomo said. He said they have started implementing a contingency plan to minimise the impact of this situation on the delivery of services. "Unfortunately, for security reasons, the Department is unable to divulge this contingency plan. We request our members to resume their duties on the basis of the commitment that we have made as a province to improve working conditions. This will be in order to allow duties to resume while we wait for a meeting on 03 December 2018 with our counterparts at National level to deal with rest of the workers’ grievances," he said. In the meantime, family can contact the Operations Centre on  0800 005 133. They will be requested to leave their details, and will be contacted and given an update. Daily News
