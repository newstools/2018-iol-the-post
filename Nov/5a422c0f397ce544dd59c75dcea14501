In August, the Department of Human Settlements announced that about 30 families, some of whom have ties to the area dating back almost a century, would be relocated to a park home, followed by formal housing in Arena Park, Savannah Park and Silverglen in Chatsworth. The department said the process would take between eight to 12 weeks. The residents, mainly small-scale farmers growing vegetables and methi herbs which they sell for R5, have been threatened by land-grabbers. Petrol bombs were hurled at their homes, prompting the department to intervene. One resident, who declined to be named, said: “We were happy about relocating but nothing has been said or done. The same promises are made year in and year out.” Another said: “We are in limbo. It’s nothing new.” The department had not responded for comment at the time of publication.
