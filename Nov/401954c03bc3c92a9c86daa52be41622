Durban - The KZN MEC for Health confirmed that there was a shortage of chemotherapy drugs in the country. Speaking at a media briefing in KZN about a range of issues, Health MEC Sibongiseni Dlomo said while the issue was not "unique" to KwaZulu Natal, it was being dealt with by the Minister of Health. Dlomo added that while there was a shortage of drugs, treatment had not been stopped any KZN public hospital. "All the hospitals that render chemotherapy are providing the treatment.” He added that the shortage of the drug named Paclitaxel - which is used for Chemotherapy was due to the supplier'. "The contracted supplier is not able to supply it in keeping with the contract and there is currently no alternate supplier and not many suppliers are involved in the manufacture of chemotherapy drugs. "The national Department of Health is working on finding alternative suppliers for importing via a section 21 permit” POST
