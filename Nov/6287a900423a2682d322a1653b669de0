Durban - The first suspect to be granted bail for the Verulam mosque bombing and a spate of bomb threats which terrorised Durban residents had his bail extended this week in the Verulam Magistrate's Court. Goolam Mahomed Rasheed Haffejee, 38, from Parlock, was arrested with 19 others on October 5 for the bomb threats and the attack on the Imam Hussein Mosque in Verulam where Abbas Essop was killed in May. Haffajee, a businessman, was the first person to be released on bail on October 15 for an amount of R100 000. As part of his bail conditions, Haffajee is not allowed to go near a port of entry or exit and had to surrender his passport. He does not have to report to any police station. His 11 co-accused were granted bail on Tuesday. Some were released on a warning. Charges against seven suspects were provisionally withdrawn. The matter was adjourned to February 22 next year.
