Two explosive performances in the 100m and 200m sprints during last month’s schools’ inter-zonal athletics meeting at the Kings Park athletics track, earned the 13-year-old his KZN colours. He won both races. Laban will turn out for the KZN team at the inter-provincial championships in Potchefstroom on November 24. His impressive showing each year at Clayridge Primary School’s athletics meetings and then at the zone competitions was confirmation of his potential as a sprinter. “I have won 20 competitions. Inter-school, inter-zone, Pinetown district and KwaZulu-Natal champs,” said Laban. His father, Denzil, said the time Laban spent with experienced Athletics South Africa coach Lux Gordhan in recent months had been significant. “Laban easily won both the 100m and 200m at the inter-zonal meeting last month,” said Denzil. Excited about his KZN call-up, Laban said that in order to prepare for the competition he trained three times a week and ensured he ate balanced meals filled with protein. Labban said he drew inspiration from Wayde van Niekerk, South African’s track-and-field sprinter and a reigning world and Olympic champion. POST
