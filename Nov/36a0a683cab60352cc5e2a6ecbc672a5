Durban - The man accused of beating a Phoenix call centre employee to death with a baseball bat was granted bail on Tuesday in the Verulam Magistrate's Court. Castello Govender, 29, a storeman, was charged with murder following the death of Christopher Padayachee, 33, on November 5. Govender was arrested on November 8 and remanded in police custody.

A  day before his death, Padayachee visited a local tavern and when he failed to return home, his family notified the police. Residents had heard screams coming from the vicinity of the Stanmore Swimming Pool and saw a group of men fleeing the scene. Govender's face was swollen and his head was covered in blood. A broken and blood-stained wooden baseball bat was found near his body. The accused was arrested four days later in Verulam by Phoenix SAPS detectives Warrant Officer PJ Moodley and Sergeant TT Ndonyel. POST
