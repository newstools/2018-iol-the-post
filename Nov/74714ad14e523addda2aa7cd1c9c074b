Durban - Sihle Zikalala, the MEC for Economic, Tourism and Environment Affairs Sihle Zikalala has welcomed the decision by Forbes Africa to host the first Africa Forbes Women Leading Women Summit in KZN. The event set to take place at the Durban ICC in March will honour women who have made a considerable contribution to socio-economic development in their respective fields of work. There are 12 award categories in the fields of science, technology and business and many more. Zikalala said the summit is more than just an event. The MEC sees it as a platform to inspire and unlock the potential for women to achieve more in their chosen careers. "It will create an avenue for women to share ideas on how to liberate themselves from patriarchal dominance that often deprive them access to life-enhancing opportunities. "The gathering must set the tone to encourage girls to aspire for leadership position to challenge their male counterparts," Zikalala stressed.
