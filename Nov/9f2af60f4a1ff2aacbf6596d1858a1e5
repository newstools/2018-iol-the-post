During sentencing, magistrate Sophie Reddy labelled Motala as a “threat to society”. Motala was also ordered to complete 16 hours of community service a month for the duration of his sentence. He is also required to undergo, at his own expense, orientation and responsibility, finance management and economic crime awareness programmes. Motala was charged with three counts of fraud pertaining to the purchase of a grocery store on Lagoon Drive in uMhlanga, in 2012. He bought the store from a construction company, Brainwave Projects. It was alleged that one of the cheques he presented to seal the deal (R465 000) was fraudulent. He was arrested in 2014 by members of the SAPS Durban North branch. He initially faced three counts of fraud, but was convicted on only one count because the State dropped two of the charges. Kunal Jugdeo, a representative of Brainwave Projects and a complainant in the matter, was not happy with the court outcome. “I wanted him to serve actual jail time for what he did. He was supposed to be a respected politician but he stole our life savings. A man like this should not be sitting in Parliament. He is a fraudster.” IFP national spokesperson Joshua Mazibuko said he was unaware of Motala’s sentencing or conviction. “Once we are notified, we will issue a statement accordingly,” he said.
