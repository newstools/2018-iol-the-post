Durban - KwaZulu Natal's first African neurologist Dr Mahlubonke Dlwati said he lived by the motto 'success is a journey which is gradual but eventual.' Armed with this knowledge passed onto him by his parents Dlwati, who is based in the Neurology Department at Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg, went on to become KZN first African neurologist after recently completed his registrar training at UKZN. Born and raised in All Saints in the rural outskirts of Engcobo in the Eastern Cape, Dlwati said his home was a stone throw away from the All Saints hospital. "My late mother used to work as a nurse at the same hospital and I saw the suffering which was endured by the rural community at the hospital and later my mother suffered the same fate,’ recalled Dlwati. After graduating with a medical degree from the University of Transkei (Walter Sisulu University), he went on to serve his internship in East London in Cecilia Makiwane hospital. After completing his internship in East London, Dlwati worked as a medical officer at the All Saints Hospital. He thereafter joined the Department of Internal Medicine at King Edward VIII (KEH) hospital as a medical officer. Speaking about his accomplishment, Dlwati said: "My parents used to say to me that success is a journey which is gradual but is eventual, you must be on a mission to succeed in life. Have goals and don't forget your goals. You may have setbacks in your life but activate the spirit of accomplishment." Dlwati said it was through his wife that he subsequently joined the UKZN registrar programme with the intention to later specialize in Neurology. "My belief is that knowledge and determination enable you to succeed and it is the source of fulfilment and satisfaction,’ said Dlwati. Daily News
