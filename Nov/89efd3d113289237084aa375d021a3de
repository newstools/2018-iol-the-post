Durban - The KwaDukuza man accused of dousing his 26-year-old partner, Trisha Naidoo, with petrol before setting her alight was found guilty of premeditated murder at the Mtunzini Magistrates Court on Monday. Nilesh Singh, 37, was convicted by Judge Esther Steyn after rejecting his version of what took place on the night of November 16, 2016. During his trial in September, Singh pleaded not guilty, claiming Naidoo set herself on fire because he threatened to leave her. He claimed he tried to help her however no evidence was found to prove this was true. Steyn found Singh was not a good witness and found various abnormalities with his conduct on the night of the incident. "Given the nature of your relationship with the deceased, you did nothing to assist her." Naidoo was doused with petrol, set alight and locked in a toilet at her Glenhills home. She managed to distinguish the flames in the adjoining shower, but suffered severe burn wounds to her hands, limbs, groin and glutens. She died two weeks later at Stanger Hospital. Singh was subsequently charged with her murder. According to the summary of substantial facts, produced by State prosecutor Cheryl Naidu, the couple shared an acrimonious relationship. In 2010, Singh is said to have left his wife to be with Naidoo who fell pregnant with their child. Sentencing is expected later this month. POST
