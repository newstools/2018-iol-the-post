Durban - The KZN MEC of Health reiterated his support of a Durban paediatrician who has taken the parents of a sick young boy to court after they refused him a blood transfusion based on religious beliefs. The parents who are Jehovah Witnesses are adamant they will not back down despite a high court order instructing that the 5-year-old, who suffers from sickle cell anaemia be given the blood transfusion if necessary. At the media briefing in Durban this week MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo said: "We support the decision by our paediatrician Noxolo Mbadi at Addington Hospital to give a child an opportunity to live through a life-saving intervention to treat sickle cell anaemia. The couple, however, said they believed in an alternate medical approach. They added that their decision was based not on cowardice but on biblical principles. Dlomo said: "As doctors, we take an oath before God when we complete our training, that neither race, nor gender, nor religion will make us withhold any treatment or intervention that can save a person from dying. "This is what confronted Dr Mbadi at Addington and when she made the decision to take this matter to court, we supported her. We'll continue supporting her." He said they want to give the child an opportunity to live. The parents will file their replying affidavits in December. Daily News
