Durban - Family members of slain garage owner Kidesh Ramjettan were held up during their Diwali celebrations at their home in Clare Estate on Wednesday night. Chairman Vincent Chetty from the Clare Estate Action Committee said the suspects had come to the home in a white Ford Fiesta. "The owners thought the suspects were family members that had come to visit and opened their gates. An armed suspect managed to gain entry into the home with his accomplices and held up the family. Household items were also taken." Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the suspects took cash, a firearm, and a cell phone. "They fled the crime scene in their getaway vehicle.  A  case of robbery was opened at Sydenham SAPS. No arrests have been made," said Mbele. For the family, this was a double blow as they are still mourning the loss of Ramjettan. They declined to comment on the robbery. Ramjettan, 37, was standing in the parking lot of his Glazer Motors petrol station in Clairwood when a gunman walked up to him and shot him in the head. He died at the scene. Ayanda Shezi, 34, a taxi driver from Johannesburg confessed to the murder he was sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime on Friday at the Durban Regional Court. POST
