Durban - The Phoenix woman caught on video allegedly abusing her 4-year-old daughter will appear in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on December 12. The 25-year-old and her 20-year-old boyfriend appeared briefly in court on Friday. The matter was adjourned for a pre-trial conference. The trial is set to start only in 2019. The woman who cannot be named to protect the identity of her child, and her boyfriend face charges of attempted murder. The mother is alleged to have kicked and stomped on her 4-year-old daughter numerous times for allegedly wetting her bed while her boyfriend allegedly recorded it. The video went viral in March and the couple was arrested thereafter. Outraged community members protested outside the courthouse following the arrest. The boyfriend's car was allegedly torched. Custody of the child was granted to the child's biological father. Part of the mother's bail conditions is that she is not allowed contact with her child. Daily News
