Durban - A South Coast traditional healer who was arrested in October with human body parts in a bucket was jailed for life in the Pietermaritzburg High Court this week. Sibusiso Mpumalani Ngidi, 34, and his neighbour Khanyisile Winnie Khusi, 42,  pleaded guilty to murdering a 17-year-old teenager by hanging him. Ngidi said he was informed by another traditional healer that killing someone would increase his strength as a healer. He said he enlisted the help of his wife, 2 girlfriends and neighbour to commit the murder. He was arrested on October 7. KZN police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the police officers had received information of a man selling body parts in Margate from as little as R4000. “During the search they discovered a bucket with a human skull, hand, torso and other body parts that were cut into small pieces. The man confirmed to police that it was indeed human body parts and he informed police that he used these items them to heal people,” Mbele said. POST
