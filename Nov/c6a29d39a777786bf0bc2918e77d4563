Thatâ€™s because people throughout the ages have always believed that there is no love greater than that of a parent for a child. Against this backdrop, there are few crimes so iniquitous as the murder of an innocent child. The issue was brought to the fore by two shocking court cases in Durban last week, in which parents were found guilty of the abuse and murder of their children. The first involved the much-publicised case of Baby X, who died on November 20, 2014. She was burned with cigarettes, battered with a variety of objects, bound with rope and denied food. The cruelties and neglect inflicted on this defenceless child and her siblings (who are now being cared for in a home) were mindless and inexcusable whatever the circumstances. In the second case a Phoenix father who pleaded guilty to strangling and killing his 7-year-old son was sentenced to 25 years in jail. He had also intended to murder his 4-year-old daughter, but she had fallen asleep. In this case, the accused claimed he committed the horrific crime to punish his wife, but there can never be any reason to take the life of a helpless and innocent child.
