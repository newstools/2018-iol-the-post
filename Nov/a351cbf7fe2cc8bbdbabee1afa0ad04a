Durban - Families who lose loved ones as a result of criminality should receive adequate feedback about the status of the police investigation. These were the sentiments of Francois Beukman, chair of the portfolio committee on police, who was responding to claims from Shallcross widow Denise Ganas regarding the lack of police feedback about her husband's murder. Her husband Nathan was killed in March 2017 in a hijacking outside their home. Beukman urged police management to address her concerns. "The detective commanders should ensure at all times that case officers give adequate feedback to complainants and families of crime victims." In an interview with POST Newspaper, Ganas said police had allegedly not returned to the area to take down statements from witnesses. "We don't know what's going on with the case. As far as I know, investigators have not taken statements from witnesses. ." However, SAPS spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said this was not true as a neighbour was interviewed. "A case of murder was opened at the Chatsworth police station. Police conducted intensive investigations from the inception of the crime being committed. "The neighbour who was interviewed could not identify the suspects as they were wearing balaclavas. The police investigation is continuing." This week Denise made headlines when she took on insurance giant Momentum and won. They had refused to pay her husband's R2,4 million life payout as they claimed he had not disclosed high blood sugar levels. POST
