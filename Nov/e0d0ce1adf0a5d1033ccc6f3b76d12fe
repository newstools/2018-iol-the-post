Durban - A Chatsworth family whose home burnt down last week received a R9000 cash donation from the Crossmoor Civic Association on Sunday. In addition to the donation the family also received clothing and household items. The Govender family of Crossmoor lost all their belongings when a fire gutted their 3 bedroom home in Crossmoor. Homeowner Killy Govender, 50, recalled how they tried to save their home from ruins but to no avail. The cause of the fire is still unknown and no one was injured. Public relations officer of the Crossmoor Civic Association, Rosalyn Marimuthu said as the civic they wanted to assist the family help “pick up the pieces”. “Our members have been with the family since day one. We helped them clean, get their chronic medication, and we offered them support. "Since the fire, we started an initiative to collect items to help them. "People from as far as Phoenix opened their hearts and donated. The family were very touched by this." The couple's son Roshantin Govender, 28, said they were touched by the generosity of the community. “We are grateful people came out and helped us. The money will go towards the home and rebuilding it. We are blessed to have such great leaders in the community.” POST
