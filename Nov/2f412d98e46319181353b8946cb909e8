Durban - It's been two months since off-duty policeman Constable Abdul Yusuf, was shot twice by robbers during a business robbery in Avoca. He has no feelings in his legs and cannot recall much of the incident on September 12 but is on the road to recovery. Yusuf, who is based at the Sydenham SAPS detective branch, had been fetching a family member at a shop in Avoca when he was shot twice by three armed men. He sustained two gunshot wounds and was initially on life support. On October 9, Yusuf was discharged from hospital and is currently recovering at a rehabilitation centre in Durban. While Yusuf said doctors were unable to confirm if he would regain full use of his legs, he said he was getting stronger every day. He said one of the bullets were lodged in his spine. Asked if he could recall anything from the day. "All I remember was drawing my firearm." He said while he would love to be home for Christmas, his wife Careen and son visited him daily. Daily News
