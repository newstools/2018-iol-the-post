Durban - The Law Society of South Africa (LSSA) has appointed an independent law firm to investigate the leakage of the Attorneys Admission Examination papers. The society said the independent whistle-blowing line, email and sms facility has been created for reporting information regarding the leakage of the exam papers. In August, four exam papers which were to be written by candidate attorneys across the country leaked - causing examinations to be rewritten. The examinations were set to be re-written last month. The society said the leakage was "unethical and unprofessional conduct" and said the decision was taken to rewrite the examinations in order to "protect the integrity and reputation of the profession." The LSSA is the umbrella body under which members of the Cape Law Society, the KwaZulu-Natal Law Society, the Law Society of the Free State, the Law Society of the Northern Provinces, the Black Lawyers Association and the National Association of Democratic Lawyers fall. The LSSA urged people who had information to come forward with the information. The information can be reported to: Toll free call 0800 number – 0800 61 12 09 SMS short code – 33490 FAX – 0800 212 689 Online reporting – www.whistleblowing.co.za E-mail – information@whistleblowing.co.za ‘All disclosures made will be treated with strict anonymity. The names and contact details of individuals making the disclosures will not be provided to the LSSA or the firm investigating the leakage unless permission has been granted by the caller,” the LSSA said.
