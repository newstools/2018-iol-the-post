Durban - Residents from Newlands East once against held a mini demonstration outside the Unilever offices at Riverhorse Valley on Monday demanding that locals be considered for jobs. Earlier this month residents protested outside the Unilever offices after they waited for six years for the company to employ them. At the previous protest, the Daily News spoke to community representative, Stoffel Diedericks, who said residents were promised jobs but nothing has materialised in the last six years. Diedericks said residents decided to march after they felt that enough was enough. A Memorandum of Understanding was handed over to Unilever on October 25. Unileverâ€™s Corporate Affairs and Sustainable Business Director, Shobna Persadh, said the company is wholly committed to working with residents, however the expected job growth has not occurred and the factory was running under capacity. She added that the priority on opening the factory was first to ensure existing employees kept working to avoid retrenchment, with an expectation of further job creation to support the community.
