Durban - An identity parade of a Phoenix man accused of allegedly conning a senior citizen out of her R50 000 Thali (gold marriage necklace), cash and a cellphone is expected to be held later this week. The man, 30, of Clayfield was arrested on October 25 and charged with fraud, a day after he allegedly conned a 72-year-old Durban North grandmother to hand over her necklace valued at about R50 000 and R700 cash. The man is alleged to have lied to the grandmother that he knew her son. He allegedly escorted the grandmother to the ATM to withdraw the money, and told her to hand over the necklace so that he could take it to be sized at jeweller in-order to complete her son's "work". Pillay said they planned on opposing bail. The man, represented by attorney Chris Gounden, is expected to appear back in court on November 12. POST
