Durban - At least six people lose their limbs every day due to diabetes complications. It is for this reason that KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Health, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, is urging residents to lead a more active and healthy lifestyle. According to the department, hospitals in the province see to about 2500 amputations each year. Speaking at the 5km Durban Wellness Festival, on the beachfront at the weekend, Dhlomo said diabetes, alongside other Non-Communicable Diseases such as hypertension, heart disease, stroke and others, has exploded and become a major problem. “We all must therefore try and increase awareness about these diseases. That is why we are also urging our fellow compatriots to make lifestyle adjustments. Getting engaged in regular exercise, getting rid of bad habits like smoking, and alcohol and substance abuse and following a healthy and balanced diet, can delay the onset of diabetes and these other diseases,” he said. With World Diabetes Day being commemorated across the globe on Wednesday,  Dhlomo urged residents to get into the habit of getting screened and tested for diabetes free of charge at public health facilities at least once a year. He said South Africans, and those who have been diagnosed with diabetes – or have a family history of it – should become more knowledgeable about the disease. He said each and every person must know about diabetes. “They must know about it more than healthcare professionals. Even if you are diagnosed with diabetes, it should not automatically follow that next year we are amputating your leg. There is a lot you can do to delay the onset of complications,” he said. Dhlomo said those are older and have been diagnosed need to share their experiences with younger generations. On Wednesday, World Diabetes Day will be commemorated across the globe under the theme “The Family & Diabetes.” The Mercury
