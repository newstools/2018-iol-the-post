Gautam, 31, of Cape Town, is suing Mrs India-South Africa owners Annulutchmee Thaver and Deon Ganas for damages amounting to more than R1.2million. She said she had not received a VW Jetta valued at about R300000 and other prizes amounting to R500000 after her win in August. She is also claiming R350000 in damages after she turned down a community post at two hospitals to fulfil her duties as the winner. Gautam said her image had been tarnished, adding that she would “fight for justice and be an advocate for all women”, so that would not happen to someone else. Ganas said Gautam had brought the brand into disrepute and had been in breach of her contract. “An initial contract that was signed by participants clearly stated that bringing disrepute to the pageant would result in immediate disqualification. She had misrepresented facts that she had not received all her prizes.” First princess Daphnie Singh will be taking over the title. POST
