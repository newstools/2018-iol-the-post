Durban - Kessie Nair is expected to make a fresh bail application on Monday and hopes he could be home for Christmas. Nair has remained behind bars since his arrest in September for allegedly calling President Cyril Ramaphosa the k-word. He faces a charge of crimen injuria. The 60-year-old appeared in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Thursday. His attorney Chris Gounden had made an application for Magistrate Ncumisa Gcolotela to recuse herself from the case; based on certain comments she allegedly made during the judgement on the first bail application. However, this application was denied. Gounden said they would be applying for bail based on new facts. Nair will be admitted to Fort Napier in April where he will undergo a mental evaluation. At the last court appearance, Gounden argued that the State was on a witch hunt to persecute Nair and “he is being persecuted because he's Indian”. Daily News
