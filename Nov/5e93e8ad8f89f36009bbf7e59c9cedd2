Durban - A 38-year-old man who repeatedly raped a pensioner in the presence of her grandchild in 2016 has been handed four life sentences. Sihle Ntembe was sentenced this week in Pinetown Regional Court. The rape took place on November 5, 2016. Ntembe entered the victim's home in KwaNdengezi where he repeatedly raped the 70-year-old woman in the presence of her grandchild. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said Ntembe then stabbed the grandmother before fleeing the scene with her cellphone and cash. Ntembe was arrested by the Chatsworth Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit. He had been hiding in Dassenhoek and was positively identified by the victim in an identity parade. He was jailed to an additional 15 years for robbery and five years for burglary. "The professional gathering of evidence by the team of detectives ensured that no impunity is granted to the perpetrator of his heinous and brutal crime," said Gwala. Daily News
