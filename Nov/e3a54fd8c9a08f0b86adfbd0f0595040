Durban - The Msunduzi Municipality has extended heartfelt condolences to the Khoza family after seven members were killed in a mass murder in Vlakfontein earlier this week Msunduzi mayor, Themba Njilo said he was saddened to hear of the murders that took place in Herwood, ward 20 Caluza. “When we visited the family earlier today, Gogo Khoza told us that the perpetrator was adopted by her late daughter Mbali Khoza early this year and lived with the family in Vlakfontein in Johannesburg,” said Njilo Njilo said the 27-year-old alleged killer asked to be adopted and told them he is also a Khoza. “Her daughter provided for and supported him with everything but now she is only left in sorrow and memories of her children as he took their lives in a gruesome manner,” he said.  He said the municipality will work together with the Department of Community Safety in Gauteng, KZN Department of Community Safety and Liaison, Department of Transport, Social Development and Sassa to support the family. “We are working with family in order to assist with funeral arrangements that is confirmed to take place in Caluza Hall on Sunday 4 November,” he said. Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane visited the house on Wednesday said the seven people killed included four female adults and three children who were all blood relatives. “We suspect that the deceased were killed on the October 19, because one of the tenants who has hired a backroom here says he last saw them on that day,” she said.
