Manicum said the academy would compete in the semi-classical category. According to its website, IIG is an international competitive event that aims to provide a global platform for dance enthusiasts. The competition is open to amateurs as well as trained professionals who are passionate about dancing. For its inaugural year, the competition will be held at the Hartland Auditorium in Dubai. “As an academy of dance our greatest hope for our time in Dubai is to be able to raise the flag of South Africa high through dance, and to be able to connect with other teams from around the world. “We’re definitely looking forward to learning by watching the different styles of dance and concepts of dance that will help us understand the way other dance academies perform,” said Manicum. “Dance is often assumed to be a really easy sport. However, once a student is registered at an academy, only then do they realise the effort and dedication that dance requires. “My team trains four times a week during the evenings. This is besides the theory that we gain from our research and the hours of watching videos online that showcase different forms and concepts of dance. “To us every form of dance is equally important, although we specialise in Bharatha Natyam. So watching other forms of dance helps us find the link that joins all the arts together.” Manicum said she was inspired by her students in her continued journey in dance. “Being able to watch a thought being visually displayed to the beat of a song is the most amazing experience. “Dance creates a world of freedom and enables the expressing of emotions through movement. It has the ability to help a child overcome stress and depression.” The team leaves for Dubai on November 14. POST latoya.newman @inl.co.za
