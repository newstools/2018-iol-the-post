Durban - Three men who gang-raped a 17-year-old girl in the presence of her 9-year-old brother received 18 terms of life imprisonment. Siboniso Magnificent Malevu, 29, Vusumuzi Sibusiso Zungu, 29, and Thokozani Andries Khumalo, 30, broke into a home in Fairbreeze, Tongaat in February 2017. "She was repeatedly gang-raped and robbed of household items at knifepoint," said Colonel Thembeka Mbele A case of rape and robbery was opened at the Dannhauser police station and assigned to the Newcastle Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for investigation. "When the 33-year-old mother heard about the incident, she had to leave her job in Johannesburg and return home. Her children had to sleep over at the neighbour's house after the incident. Towards the end of March 2017 whilst the mother was sleeping, one of her daughter's attackers broke into her house armed with a knife. "He told her that he came to kill her daughter because they have heard that she opened a case against them. When he realized that she was not at home, he repeatedly raped the mother." Mbele said a case was opened at the Dannhauser police station and Newcastle Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit. "Investigators swiftly arrested all three accused, three days later. They were positively identified by both victims at an identification parade and linked by DNA. " This week the  Madadeni High Court sentenced each of the accused to five terms of life imprisonment for raping the daughter and 15 years imprisonment for housebreaking and robbery with aggravating circumstances. Khumalo was also given an additional three terms of life imprisonment for raping the mother. Daily News
