Durban -  A Kloof homeowner spoke of his pain and anguish and the ability to have his sight restored after a cobra spat its venom on his eyes. Michael Bestenbreur,47, a self-employed carpenter, said his pregnant daughter had seen the snake in her room on Tuesday night. Bestenbreur took a glance around the room but could not find it. He returned a short while later and guessed that it must be hidden under a bag in a poorly lit corner of the room. "I lifted the bag up and there it was coiled up. It snapped at him so to make sure what I was dealing with I asked my wife Kerry to fetch a torch. The snake must have been 80 centimetres away from my face. I just felt something hot and wet on my face," Bestenbruer said. He dropped the bag and screamed for help while stumbling to a nearby hand wash basin in the room. "It was like looking through a frosty glass. Kerry then guided me outside where I used a garden hose to pour water on my eyes for about 15 minutes. I also poured warm milk into my eyes. The burn was unbearable." he said. He was rushed to Hillcrest Hospital and then diverted to St Augustines Hospital for treatment and where they had antivenom. "It was quite a spectacle having a whole lot of people around me in the hospital. They had these suction tubes that poured liquid and sucked liquid from my eyes," he said. On Wednesday he had bandages over both his eyes for the entire day. "It was not a nice experience. My eyeballs were puffy and sore. It was a happy feeling to have my sight back again." he said. The family had three previous encounters with snakes because they live near the Krantz Kloof nature reserve. Bestenbreur said the snake came in through the window. He will now place screens around each window to prevent snakes from entering the home. He thanked his wife Kerry for her support during the ordeal. Nick Evans of the KwaZulu-Natal Amphibian and Reptile Conservation who had removed the snake confirmed it was a Mozambique Spitting Cobra. Daily News
