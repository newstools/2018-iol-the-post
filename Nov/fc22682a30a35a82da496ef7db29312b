Durban - A Richmond Farm pastor is expected to appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrate's Court on Monday facing charges of four counts of rape. The 35-year-old pastor who has a church in Richmond Farm was arrested on Thursday after he allegedly preyed on young girls. According to police, the pastor allegedly preyed on young females of single-headed households. He often acted as a fatherly figure. SAPS spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said one of the alleged victims claimed that she had asked the pastor to pray for her when she was ill. "The pastor prayed for her and then requested her to get into his vehicle and took her to his residence at Avoca where he allegedly raped her." "For the past three years, the victim was silent about the incident and she only reported the rape to Ntuzuma police station this month," said Mbele. Mbele added that angry members of the community damaged the church tent upon hearing of the news. "They demanded that he not return to the area." POST
