Durban - "There is no salmonella outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal." This is according to MEC for Health in KwaZulu-Natal, Sibongiseni Dlomo. He was addressing the media at a briefing at Truro House in Durban on Monday morning. "We wish to categorically state that there is no outbreak of salmonella in the province. The matter has to do with poorly prepared food." To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

Last week The Mercury reported that at least 20 people were hospitalised with suspected salmonella food poisoning after eating at the popular Old Town Italy restaurant in Umhlanga at the weekend. It is believed the restaurant's famous Hollandaise sauce - made from raw egg - is the source of the outbreak however the establishment owner said they are awaiting results from the lab to confirm. Owner of Old Town Italy, Renzo Scribante told the paper that they have been in contact with the Department of Health to get to the bottom of the issue and have taken the necessary precautions. POST
