Durban - Unilever South Africa will next month advertise 15 learnerships in local newspapers ensuring applicants from the Newlands community are considered for recruitment. The move comes in the wake of protests staged at the company’s Riverhorse Valley premises in recent weeks. On Monday, a small group of people protested at the site demanding that locals be employed at the plant. Unilever Corporate Affairs & Sustainable Business Director, Shobna Persadh, said the company is also working with partners to identify an appropriate programme to be offered in 2019 to support Maths and Science for senior high schools, prioritising the community as part of the programme. “These commitments directly address concerns raised in a memorandum delivered by the community on October 25 over local employment and corporate social responsibility activity. The company confirmed that it employs a total of 57 people from the Newlands area – 18 of them at its flagship Indonsa factory and the remainder at its Head Office in La Lucia and the Maydon Wharf and Phoenix factories,” she said. Persadh said they will  continue to prioritise employment of Newlands community members at Indonsa when vacancies arise and to play a positive role in community development. Daily News
