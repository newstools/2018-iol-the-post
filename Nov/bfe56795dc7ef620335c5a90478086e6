Durban - NETCARE St Augustine’s Hospital reached a medical milestone this week after completing their 100th transcatheter aortic valve intervention (TAVI) procedure. Interventional cardiologist, Dr Jaivadan Patel and cardiothoracic surgeon Dr Keith Odayan together with their team at the hospital performed the TAVI early on Monday on 82-year-old Vernie Pautz. The TAVI is a potentially life-saving operation in which a diseased heart valve is replaced with artificial valves. The managing director of the Netcare hospital division, Jacques Du Plessis congratulated the team on the completion of their 100th procedure. “The highly experienced team at the hospital have been performing the procedure for close on a decade. During this time they have consistently achieved outstanding clinical outcomes, and saved the lives of many of these highly compromised patients,” he said. He added that the TAVI centre at the hospital is the only dedicated facility of its kind in KZN. Dr Patel and Dr Odayan, both of whom have been instrumental in developing the TAVI service at the hospital, said that they were most gratified that the team had attained this milestone, and thanked all of the doctors and staff members who had played a role in the establishment of the centre. The patient spent less than 24 hours in the hospital’s intensive care unit following the procedure before being transferred back to the general ward. POST
