Durban - The founder of Africa's first medicinal cannabis dispensary in Durban will open its first franchise in Ballito on Friday. Krithi Thaver, of the Holistic Releaf brand, said the 2017 launch of the Holistic Relief Wellness and Pain Management Centre in Durban North had been so successful, a decision was made to open a Medicinal Cannabis consultancy and dispensary in Ballito. "When we opened the first centre in June last year, we only had six employees, now we have 21 employed staff. Business is definitely booming," said Thaver who is also chairperson of the Cannabis Development Council of South Africa and Canna Culture SA. Dr Regina Hurley, a specialist Anesthesiologist, is expected to deliver a presentation on the science of medical cannabis during the official opening of the Ballito store. This will be followed by a live performance by Kyle Deutsch of Idols SA fame. Thaver, a cannabis activist for 10 years said the Holistic Releaf Centres offers products that are certified and tested at the highest levels and conducts extensive training on the benefits and dispensing of natural and highly effective cannabis medication. "The non-toxic, alternate treatments used at Holistic Releaf include the full spectrum of cannabinoids which are responsible for the management of a number of conditions. Holistic Releaf plan on opening many wellness centres around the country, including Midrand and Fourways in Johannesburg." On December 1, Thaver said that a Holistic Releaf franchise will be opening in Queensburgh. POST
