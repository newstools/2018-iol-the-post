Durban - A 50-year-old man who pleaded guilty to being in possession of 50 heroin capsules in the Chatsworth Magistrate's Court on Thursday said he purchased them for a friend. Jaypeagasen Archary, a father of two, from Springfield, opted to pay a fine rather than go to jail. He said that he had been asked by a friend to go to the Bayview, Chatsworth area on July 24, 2018 to purchase the drugs. Archary was arrested the same day. He was fined R10 000 or 12 months imprisonment. Half of the sentence was suspended. Archary opted to pay the R5000 fine. In a separate incident, a man who police have been looking for since 2016 for alleged drug possession was arrested this week. Mlungisi Maphumulo, 26, was charged with 5 counts of heroin possession and the matter was adjourned for November 19 for a bail application. He was allegedly found in possession of drugs in the Klaarwater, Chatsworth area. Daily News
