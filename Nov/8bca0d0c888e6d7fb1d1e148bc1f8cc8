The Western Cape High Court on Monday granted advocate Joey Moses and attorney Craig Duncan an application to remove themselves from the case as their client was no longer able to pay for their services. Taariq Phillips was acquitted of murder but found guilty on September 11 of two counts of rape. He and his then-girlfriend were part of a group of friends and acquaintances who attended a rave party at the La Bac Estate in Paarl on New Year’s Eve, 2013, when Chauhan became ill early on January 1, 2014. The woman was taken to the couple’s tent and after the pair were alone for some time, Chauhan started having seizures. She was transported to the Paarl Medi-Clinic where she died later on New Year’s Day. Judge Lee Bozalek expressed his annoyance that the trial had hit a snag once again and Legal Aid advocate Burger Brandt was forced to jump in at the 11th hour. Sentencing proceedings got under way on Monday morning with Judge Bozalek saying the matter had dragged on for too long and he was not going to grant a further postponement. The court heard testimony from an official from the Department of Correctional Services about their requirements, should Phillips receive correctional supervision as his sentence. The court also heard from a family friend of the victim’s mother, Geetesh Solanki, who testified about the devastating effect Chauhan’s murder has had on her family. “At no stage did the accused show remorse. We still have so many questions. "The fact that we still don’t know what happened in that tent means that we have (been) sentenced to a life in pain,” said Solanki. The State intends to ask for a sentence of 18 years for the double rape. The court was also expected to hear from Chauhan’s mother. POST
