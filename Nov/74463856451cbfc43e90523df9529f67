Durban - The family of Kidesh Ramjettan, who was shot outside his business in August, has welcomed the life sentence of the triggerman. Ayanda Shezi, 34, was sentenced to life imprisonment by Magistrate Samuel Luthuli at the Durban Magistrate's Court on Friday. He pleaded guilty on Thursday to shooting Ramjettan execution style. Ramjettan’s older brother Anesh Balraj said the family is relieved the shooter got a life sentence. “We are still waiting to find out who actually paid for the hit. We know that part of the money (R30 000) was paid to these people.”  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

He said his wage of R2000 as a taxi driver was not enough. However handing down sentencing, Luthuli said the murder was preplanned in Johannesburg and the fact that Shezi conducted the shooting execution style outweighs the fact that he pleaded guilty. POST
