Durban - Saying "enough is enough" with the rate of crime in Durban, the Mohammedeya Musjid in Overport will be holding a mass interfaith gathering on November 21. Interfaith and community leaders who will be present include; Moulana Ebrahim of the Mohammedeya Musjid, Conquering Through Prayer's Pastor Clive Gopaul, Cardinal Wilfrid Napier, Sydenham CPF Head Satish Dhupelia and Mayor Zandile Gumede. The Musjid said in a statement: "Peace, tolerance and respect are the essential lubricants of life without the gears of society will jam and cause an ignition of discord. We have unfortunately reached that stage of instability with a constant feeling of insecurity, due to our lives being enveloped by the increase of crime in our community." The gathering seeks to address the rate of murder, rape, abuse and hijackings in the area.  The Musjid said a memorandum will be handed over to the mayor and other heads of the departments demanding an end to crime. The gathering will take place on November 21 outside the musjid on Moses Kotane Road in Overport at 8 pm. Daily News
