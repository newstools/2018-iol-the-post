“Aunty Sheila is inspired by my late granny, a woman who never had a filter,” explained Naicker. “She said what was on her mind. Although she was vocal and never minced her words, everyone still loved her. They knew that her heart was in the right place. When she passed away, I was devastated and wanted to keep her legacy alive. At the end of 2016, I released my first video, and it just went viral,” he said. Having been involved in stage plays and local films on DStv and the SABC from the age of nine, Naicker began doing theatre “more seriously” in 2007. “I think what I enjoy the most is when I hear people say that after a long, hard day, the best way to relax and smile is by playing an Aunty Sheila video,” he said. On November 25, Naicker and his crew will bring to stage Aunty Sheila You’re Hired!. “There is a brand-new script. It takes the audience on Aunty Sheila’s journey as she seeks employment. Finding the right job for her is difficult until she realises her greatest purpose in life is doing what she has always been doing - giving advice,” he laughed. The comedy-drama promises to leave audiences rolling off their seats with laughter. “Aunty Sheila tackles serious issues such as extramarital affairs, black magic, insecurity issues as well as sexual differences which the Indian community wants to talk about, but shy away from,” said Naicker. * The show takes place on November 25 at Stanmore Hall in Phoenix. Tickets can be bought from Maharaj’s Prayer Shop at the Plaza and Gem City, or from Computicket and Shoprite/Checkers stores. Call 0833542974 for more information. POST
