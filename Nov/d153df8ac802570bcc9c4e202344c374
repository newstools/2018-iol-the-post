Durban - Convicted murderer Rajivee Soni is expected to appear in the Durban High Court today to apply for leave to appeal his murder conviction. Soni was found guilty of murdering Pietermaritzburg doctor Bhavish Sewram in May 2013 after he suspected that he was involved in an affair with his wife. Sewram was gunned down outside his surgery in Chota Motala Road, Raisethorpe. The father of two died at the scene. On October 26, Soni was jailed for 30 years. His bail was revoked and Soni is currently in jail. In his plot to kill the doctor, Soni enlisted the help of former policeman Brian Treasurer with an offer of R100 000 to carry out the deed. Treasurer accepted and then enlisted the services of Mfaniseni Nxumalo and Sabelo Dlamini, promising to pay them if they assisted him. On 13 May 2013, Treasurer, Nxumalo and Dlamini drove to the doctor’s surgery. Treasurer waited in the vehicle, while Dlamini went out and shot the deceased who died at the scene. All were sentenced to life in imprisonment. Treasurer died in prison in Daily News
