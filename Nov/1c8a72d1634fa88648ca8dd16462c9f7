Cole, 14, who was a Grade 9 pupil at Burnwood Secondary School, sustained severe head injuries. He died soon after paramedics took him to Addington Hospital. His aunt, Sharon Kallee, said the teen’s death had left their family shattered. “Last Saturday he left home to go to the youth meeting and as he was crossing O’Flaherty Road he was struck by a car. Residents from the area contacted the ambulance and he was transported to the hospital. His injuries were too severe and he died.” His parents, Shaun and Jenny, said they were struggling to come to terms with his death and were expected to undergo counselling. “Cole was a lovely and respectful child. He had a bright future and had dreams of becoming an architect. We are praying that we can get clarity in terms of what had happened last Saturday.” His funeral was held last Wednesday at the Believers Christian Church in Asherville. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of culpable homicide was opened at Sydenham SAPS. He said no one had been arrested or charged as police were still investigating. POST
