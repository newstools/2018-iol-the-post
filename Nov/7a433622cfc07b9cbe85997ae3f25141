In the Mtunzini Magistrate’s Court yesterday, Judge Esther Steyn convicted Nilesh Singh, 37, for the murder of Trisha Naidoo, 26. In passing judgment, Judge Steyn said she found several abnormalities in Singh’s version of events, which made her reject his evidence about what took place that night. During his trial in September, Singh pleaded not guilty. He claimed Naidoo had set herself on fire because he had threatened to leave her. He said when he heard her screams, he tried to help her but her family intervened. Judge Steyn found that Singh was not a good witness and said the evidence showed his conduct on the night was questionable. “Given the nature of your relationship with the deceased, I find that your conduct was abnormal in that you did nothing to assist her.” Judge Steyn said she also found it strange that Singh did not unlock the door for her family. They testified they had to force the door open after several unanswered calls to Singh. The judge also questioned why Singh did not call the emergency services after he found Naidoo. Singh had also told her family and doctors that she had set herself alight, which Judge Steyn found “odd”. “Why would she say she did it to herself? It was clear that the deceased did things to please her partner and was afraid of him.” Naidoo was doused with petrol, set alight and locked in a toilet at her Glenhills home on November 16, 2016. She suffered severe burns and died in Stanger Hospital two weeks later. State prosecutor Cheryl Naidu said the couple shared an acrimonious relationship. In 2010, Singh is said to have left his wife for Naidoo, who fell pregnant with their child. Sentencing is expected later this month. POST
