Durban - Renowned comedian, Loyiso Gola is set to perform in Durban in December. Gola, who has just completed performing on ‘Live at the Apollo’ and recording a Netflix special in Montreal, Canada is returning to grace the new venue at Suncoast Casino and Entertainment World as he thrills fans at his Unlearning show. The show, which will challenge societal norms, making the audience question everything they thought they knew about politics, race, history and more, is scheduled for December 15. Speaking ahead of the show, Gola said it will look into unpacking what people are taught growing up. “This show delves into unpacking what we’ve learnt growing up, viewing the world differently and realising that there’s a need to unlearn it instead of being stuck in our own stereotypical mindsets.  I go through a process of attempting to ‘unlearn’ some thoughts and preconceptions about relationships, masculinity, race, things that I’m currently going through and are pertinent in my life and I get to share this with the audience.” Gola will also be featured in a new stand-up comedy event series with Netflix set to premiere in early 2019, that will feature 47 comedians from around the globe. He is one of four South African comedians who will have their own half-hour special feature.  POST
