Durban - Shortly after an Isipingo Hills senior citizen was strangled to death in her home on Thursday, a suspect has been arrested. The 66-year-old woman, of Spathodia Drive, was found lying lifeless in the passageway of her home. Neighbours who heard her screams for help had alerted her daughter. According to a source, a former employee of the woman's son had come to the home wanting to speak to him about getting his job back. Isipingo CPF chairman Aidan David said armed with a description of the suspect, CPF members together with SAPS members combed the area in search of the man. "Also using technology, we were able to pick up the phone signal which directed us to a petrol garage in the Isipingo CBD area. The suspect matching the description was spotted. He was also found in possession of the phone," said David. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a suspect was arrested and a case of murder is being investigated by the Isipingo SAPS. POST
