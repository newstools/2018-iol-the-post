Durban - The bail application of the suspects believed to be linked to several bomb threats in and around Durban, is currently taking place in the Verulam Magistrate's Court. Eleven men of the 19 men arrested in October are applying for bail. Charges against seven of the suspects were withdrawn, while Goolam Haffajee, 38, was released on R100 000 bail. Asherville businessman Farhad Hoomer, 42, has been fingered as the ring leader. Meanwhile, the defence argued on Tuesday that the State's case was weak. Advocate Joe Wolmarans who is representing accused Ahmad Haffajee, 28, disputed that his client was actively part of an Iranian militant Whatsapp group. He argued that Haffajee had been added on to the group. Wolmarans further argued that the only link Haffejee had to the mosque attack was the signal from a cellphone tower close to the Imam Hussein Mosque in Verulam. Acting on behalf of the remaining accused, Advocate Sinthamanie Naidu, said her clients were arrested because they were present at the time of the arrests and were attending prayer in Fullham Road, Reservoir Hills. State Prosecutor Adele Barnard said the evidence against the accused needed to be looked at in its totality. Barnard said in a statement accused Omar Iddy had fingered Hoomer as the ISIS ringleader. Iddy said he was instructed by Hoomer to transport two men with an incendiary device to the Woolworths at the Gateway Shopping Mall. The bail application is continuing. POST
