Durban - An elderly man is due appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court on Friday on charges of fraud and malicious damage to property after he allegedly sold land illegally in the Inanda area. The man and his accomplices caught the attention of police last year after cases were opened by farmers in the area. “Following a protracted investigation which included the involvement of the office of the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions in KZN, a controlled operation was conducted and the suspect sold private land to police agents for R20 000. His associates fled when they received news of his arrest at the Mzinyathi area in Inanda and police are currently looking for two more suspects,” said provincial SAPS spokesperson, Brigadier Jay Naicker. He more charges may likely be added following his court appearance. Naicker said police are appealing for the outstanding suspects to hand themselves over police. “We are also appealing to those that bought land illegally in that area to come forward as soon as possible and co-operate with the investigating officers. Those who have information that is pertinent in this investigation are requested to contact the investigating officer, Detective Warrant Officer Mlungwana on 082 6627 764,” Naicker said. Daily News
