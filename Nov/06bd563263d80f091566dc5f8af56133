Durban - Murder accused Ayanda Shezi has pleaded guilty to pulling the trigger and killing Durban businessman Kidesh Ramjettan. He made the plea in the Durban Regional Court today. Ramjettan was shot dead outside his Rossburgh business in August. He was standing in the parking lot of his Glazer Motors petrol station in Clairwood when a gunman walked up to him and shot him in the head. He died at the scene. State prosecutor Surekha Marimuthu told the court that the state recommended a minimum sentence of life imprisonment. Shezi has pleaded for the courts mercy. The case is continuing. His brother, Anesh Balraj, previously said they suspected Ramjettan's murder was a hit. The family had recently offered a reward of R300 000 for information leading to his killers' arrests. Ramjettan, a father of one, has been described by his family as a "lovable person" who always went the extra mile to help others. POST
