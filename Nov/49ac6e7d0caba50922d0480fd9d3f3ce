urban - A South Coast man who pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography will be sentenced on December 10. Shane Jordaan, 25, appeared in the Scottburgh Magistrate's Court on Friday, NPA spokesperson Natasha Ramkissoon confirmed. Jordaan, who lived with his grandmother in Pennington, had been in possession of 5 176 images depicting child abuse in a sexual light as well as 142 videos at the time of his arrest. He was arrested by Interpol in 2015 and is currently out on R1 000 bail. Jordaan pleaded guilty in August this year to possession of child pornography. The State is asking for a prison sentence. Attorney Paul Ramasar addressed the court in mitigation of sentencing. Ramasar told the court that his client has not viewed any pornography in the last 3 years and that he should receive a correction supervision sentence and house arrest for three years. He contended that Jordaan should attend a rehabilitation programme to wean him of porn. Pietermaritzburg psychologist Clive Willows testified that Jordaan has the mental capacity of a 12-year-old child. Jordaan is currently unemployed and receiving a disability grant. Daily News
