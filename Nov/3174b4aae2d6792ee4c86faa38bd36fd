Durban - BE WEARY of smooth talking swindlers, who sell cannabis-based products with the promise that it cures all ailments, including cancer. That is the cautionary advice of Roy Sukdhev of the Phoenix North Coast Cancer Support Group, who will highlight their concerns about cannabis at a community meeting with IFP MP Narend Singh on Sunday. "While the Western Cape High Court ruled that the use of cannabis at home is legal, there are still concerns about those seeking it for medical use, more specifically the side-effects of cancer," said Sukdhev. He added that with the legalisation, came abuse and recklessness. "Abuse by people selling them as cures is extremely dangerous and there seems to be a lot of smooth talkers and swindlers capitalising on gullible people looking for the cure for their ailments. There must be controls and checks in place to avoid abuse." Singh said he would enlighten the public about the latest developments on regulations and the purchasing of illegal products. "Since the ruling, a number of products are available but are not authentic. It has not been certified by the South African Health Products Regulatory Agency, which means it could have adverse effects." He will also touch on cannabis being used for recreational and medical purposes. Following the discussion, an educational and empowerment programme, Educate to Medicate, will be held with medical professionals, dispensers and patients. The Western Cape High Court ruled in September that cannabis could be grown at home and used for personal use. The meeting will take place at the Mount Edgecombe Conference Centre at 2pm. POST
