Durban - Residents in Glenwood and Musgrave have been without electricity for most of Thursday morning. According to Eskom, this is as a result of increased generation plant being out for planned maintenance and unplanned outages. The utility giant said Stage 1 rotational loadshedding will be implemented from midday until 10pm on Thursday. Stage 1 rotational loadshedding requires 1000MW to be loadshed nation-wide. Loadshedding is conducted as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout. "We encourage residents and businesses to please use electricity sparingly to ease the demand of electricity. Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand," Eskom said. Customers are advised to keep checking their load shedding schedules on the Eskom website or municipal websites to determine when they are due to get loadshedding. For Eskom customers, these schedules are available on the Eskom website (http://loadshedding.eskom.co.za). Eskom customers can also contact our Customer Contact Centre at 0860 037Â 566. Daily News
