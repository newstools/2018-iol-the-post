Durban - KZN MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Nomusa Dube-Ncube, has welcomed news of the arrest of two suspects allegedly linked to the murder of Richmond municipal manager Sibusiso Sithole.

Two suspects appeared in the Richmond Magistrate's Court and the case was postponed to next Monday. Cogta said Sithole's death shocked the local government fraternity and turned the spotlight on the safety of municipal officials. “We welcome the news of the arrest and we hope this will bring us closer to the truth about the murder of the Municipal Manager. "Our hope remains in the hands of law enforcement agencies to bring to book all those who tarnish the image of our province by murdering municipal officials.  We now urge the judiciary to expedite this case so that much-needed closure materializes for the family, colleagues and the community that Mr Sithole served before his untimely death,” said KZN MEC for Cogta Nomusa Dube-Ncube. KZN Cogta said it repeatedly condemned violence against elected representatives and officials in the province’s municipalities. Daily News
