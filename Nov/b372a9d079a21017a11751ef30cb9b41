Durban - Kessie Nair, the man accused of allegedly calling President Cyril Ramaphosa appeared briefly in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Monday. Nair, 60, was arrested in September and charged for crimen injuria. His video went viral on social media. Nair will report to Fort Napier in April for a psychiatric evaluation. His first bail application was denied in October. His attorney Chris Gounden made an application for the Magistrate to recuse herself following comments she allegedly made. This was denied. On Monday Gounden made a second application for bail presenting new facts. The matter was adjourned for to Friday as the State required a fully comprehensive affidavit as to where Nair would stay and who would bring him to court should he be granted bail. At his previous court appearance, Nair said he suffered from a heart condition and could not be in prison as he is on an organ transplant list and needs to be readily available for the transplant when a heart becomes available for him.
