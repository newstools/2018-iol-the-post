Playing in the curtain-raiser to the Currie Cup final, Chetty’s Sharks Under 19 team romped home to a 40-27 win over their Bulls counterparts to finish as champs in their division. There were a multitude of reasons that made the victory even more sweet for Chetty, who is the team’s manager. Winning the trophy for the first time in 10 years and maintaining an unbeaten record in the competition (14 consecutive wins) would have made the triumph extra special for Chetty and his charges. They also scored 95 tries during the season. “I’m extremely proud of our team. They have excelled on and off the field,” said Chetty. “I have been a part of trophy-winning teams in the amateur ranks before, but this is my biggest rugby achievement.” Chetty said his team’s captain, Phendalani Buthelezi, Muller du Plessis, JJ van der Mesht and Dylan Richardson had all shown signs of being future stars. He added that preparations for the new season would begin in earnest in two weeks' time. POST
