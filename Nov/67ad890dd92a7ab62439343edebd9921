The court had ordered Anisa Sayed-Khan, 39, of Phoenix, and Zaahidah Khan, 33, of Westville, to repay their mother Zora Khan, 58, the money she had inherited from her late husband Wassir in 2015. In August, Magistrate Anand Maharaj sentenced the sisters to five years in prison, suspended for five years on condition they are not convicted of a similar crime during this period; and that they each repay their mother R750000 by the end of October. Yesterday, Zora Khan said she had not received payment from her daughters. “I feel upset. I didn’t ask for the whole amount, just for the funds they used up from their father’s inheritance.” Prosecutor Kuveshnie Pillay confirmed that warrants of arrest had been issued and that the State was applying to put the suspended sentence in place. When contacted, the daughters’ defence attorney Saleem Khan said the matter was at a crucial stage. They are expected to return to court next week. It is alleged that soon after their father’s death, the sisters offered to help their mother with her financial affairs. They convinced her to sign up for internet banking and hand over the passwords to them. They then transferred money, on various occasions, from her account into two separate accounts without her consent or knowledge. Sayed-Khan had also called the bank and claimed to be her mother. She cancelled the SMS notification feature, so that her mother would not be alerted to the transactions. The mother realised something was amiss when she received an SMS from Capitec Bank that her funds had been depleted. Her daughters ignored her calls and were arrested in 2016 and granted R20000 bail each. POST
