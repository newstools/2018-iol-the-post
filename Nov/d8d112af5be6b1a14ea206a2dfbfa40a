Durban - An interfaith prayer was hosted at the Overport Secondary School on Wednesday with residents calling for an end to the recent upsurge in crime. Residents living in Sydenham and Overport have said in recent months there has been a notable increase in robberies and hijackings. Last week, a teenager was shot dead and another critically wounded following a drive-by shooting in Georgehill, off Randles Road. Joshua Wilson was a Grade 12 pupil at Burnwood Secondary School. It is alleged that he was shot in the neck. No arrests have been made for his murder. Before that, a local crimefighter was wounded after a gang of men tried to rob a home in Overport. Musher Khan was shot while attending to a home robbery. The incident took place in Essendene Road. The shooter was believed to have been carrying an AK47. Bullet fragments were removed from Khan’s skull. Speaking about the prayer meeting, one of the organisers, Nazir Malek, said it was well attended despite the cooler weather. “We decided to pull all members of the community together, irrespective of religion, to come together and pray for our community. There is an escalation of crime and we wanted to bring this to the attention of the police and city management,” he said. Malek said the community believes that enough is enough! “We are fed up of the shootings and hijackings,” he added. The meeting was also attended by local police management and Deputy Mayor in eThekwini, Fawzia Peer. “Both police management and Councillor agreed that we all need to work together to fight crime,” Malek said.
