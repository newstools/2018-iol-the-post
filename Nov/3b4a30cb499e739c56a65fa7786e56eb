Basdeo, 58, the former superintendent at Sydenham police station, is accused of murdering his second wife, Dawn Basdeo, 57. He also faces charges of defeating the ends of justice. Despite an extensive search by her family and police, her body has not been recovered. In June, he reported that Dawn had gone missing. Six days later, he was arrested and charged with her murder. Last Wednesday, he was granted bail with the following conditions: that he hand in his passport; is precluded from applying for any travel document; is precluded from travelling outside of Gauteng without the investigation officer’s consent; is precluded from contacting any witness; and has to report to his local police station on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. In a post on the Facebook page JusticeforDawn, which is administered by her family, they said they were devastated and angry. “But we focus now on his trial and the very strong case the State has against this vile human for murder, perjury and defeating the ends of justice. Please keep the family in your thoughts and prayers. We will obtain #JusticeforDawn.” The former Southgate, Phoenix, man was charged with the murder of his first wife, Neetha, but walked free when the case was thrown out of court. Soon afterwards, he moved to Gauteng where he married Dawn. In 2016, he resigned from the SAPS to start a trucking business. POST
