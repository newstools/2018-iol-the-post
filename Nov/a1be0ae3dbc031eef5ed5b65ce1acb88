In passing sentence, Durban High Court Judge Mohini Moodley said Baby X had been denied her constitutional right to life and basic needs such as nutrition and care by her mother. “A defenceless and totally dependent young child died as a result of the act of violence perpetrated on her by her mother with a high-heeled shoe,” the judge said. “But she faced imminent death anyway, as a result of prolonged starvation and continued abuse at the hands of both her mother and grandmother,” Judge Moodley added. The woman, who cannot be named to protect the identity of her other children, was convicted on 11 charges, including child abuse, assault and murder. The woman’s mother, who was also charged with murder, child abuse and sexual assault, died of natural causes earlier this year, while awaiting trial at Westville Prison. Judge Moodley said Baby X’s brother had attempted to bring to light the abuse by speaking to his teachers at school, but there had been no follow-up by the school authorities. “Had the abuse been properly investigated and referred to the police or social welfare authorities, this tragic outcome may have been averted,” the judge pointed out. “This begs the question of just how many other children seek assistance and are failed similarly by teachers who are meant to be in loco parentis, while the children are in their care.” Judge Moodley said social workers had visited the home, but failed to find anything wrong, despite visible evidence, specifically on Baby X. “The signs of abuse were clearly visible. Following the manual, she was a textbook case of abuse and deliberate neglect, which the social worker failed to observe or deliberately ignored.” POST
