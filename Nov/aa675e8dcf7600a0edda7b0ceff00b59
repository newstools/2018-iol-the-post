Durban - The Chatsworth mother found guilty of abusing and killing her 3-year-old daughter, Baby X in 2014 was sentenced to an effective 20 years in the Durban High Court on Thursday. The woman’s name is not being revealed to protect the identities of her three surviving minor children. In September, she was found guilty of three counts of child abuse, a count of ­assault GBH and failure to provide medical assistance, as well as murder. She was also found guilty of two counts of child abuse, failure to provide medical assistance and assault GBH for her then 11-year-old son, and child abuse of her then 8-year-old daughter. Her other daughter, who was 2 at the time, was spared the abuse. The mother’s co-accused - the children’s grandmother - who had also been standing trial, died in prison in April. Baby X died on November 20, 2014, due to blunt force trauma to the head and brutal child abuse. During the trial, it emerged that Baby X had been burnt with cigarettes on her private area and other parts of her body, had been battered, had chilli powder placed in her nappy, had been bound with rope and denied food. Prior to her death, it was heard that the Baby X had been beaten with a high-heeled shoe and bound by her hand and legs to the bed with rope, and a plastic packet put over her head. She was declared dead the next day. POST
