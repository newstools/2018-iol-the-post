Durban - The man accused of murdering a Phoenix mother and her two daughters in September is expected to appear in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. Colin Pillay, a tow truck driver, faces charges of three counts of premeditated murder and one of robbery with aggravating circumstances for the brutal murders of Jane Govindsamy, 45, an employee at a logistics company and her daughters Denisha, 22, and Rackelle, 16,  Grade 11 pupil at Rydal Park Secondary. Their bodies were discovered at their Longcroft, Phoenix home on September 21 by their father Sagren Govindsamy. It is uncertain if Pillay will go ahead with his bail application. At his last court appearance on October 15, he abandoned his bail application. His attorney Chris Gounden said they were unable to go ahead with the bail application because they were waiting for statements Pillay had made to police. The murders sparked outrage in the community. Daily News
