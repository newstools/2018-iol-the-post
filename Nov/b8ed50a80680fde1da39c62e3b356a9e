Durban - As the festive season begins and malls began extending their shopping hours to accommodate the shoppers, operations director of Blue Security, Brian Jackson, shares his safety tips. "Shoppers should also be vigilant in shopping malls and parking lots and take care to ensure vehicles are locked to avoid becoming a victim of remote jamming. Busy shopping malls are places where criminals such as pickpockets love to hang out," explained Jackson. He advises the following: • Keep your wallet and cellphone out of sight in your handbag which should be closed at all times. • If you do have your cellphone in your hand because you have just taken a call, put it away straight afterwards to avoid misplacing it on a store counter. • Always manually check to see that your car doors have locked because remote jammers can target vehicles anywhere, from street parking in the suburbs to secure shopping mall covered parking lots. • Avoid leaving valuables such as laptops and tablets in the car but if this can’t be avoided, make sure it is locked away out of sight in the boot.
