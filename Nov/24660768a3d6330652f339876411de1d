Durban - A Durban magistrate has described the contract killing of Durban businessman Kidesh Ramjettan as a heinous crime. Magistrate Samuel Luthuli did not mince his words as he jailed Ayanda Shezi, 34, to life in jail for the crime in the Durban Regional Court on Friday. In his guilty plea Shezi, a father of four, said he was hired and paid R30 000 to kill Ramjettan in August. He told the court that he needed money to pay for his aunt's funeral and to support his 4 biological children and his sisters' two children. Magistrate Luthuli said it was unclear to the court if Shezi was truly remorseful for what he did. “After carrying out murder, he went to his family home in Ulundi where he stayed for three days and then went to Johannesburg and carried on with his life as though nothing happened." Luthuli added that said it seemed that Shezi only confessed because he had been arrested by police. Shezi had his head down as sentence was passed. In a victim impact statement, State Prosecutor Surekha Marimuthu told the court that Ramjettan's family found it difficult to come to terms with his death. POST
