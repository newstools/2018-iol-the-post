Durban - Dozens of people have arrived at the South African Hindu Maha Sabha’s 20th annual Durban Diwali Festival on Sunday morning to take part in a mass Hawan prayer. Convenor, Dhunluxmi Desai, said there are 108 Hawan kunds and all the ingredients, including ghee, saamagri, wood, camphor and tea-lights, were provided for those participating. “This is one of the biggest prayers, with priests from different linguistic groups that will be conducting prayers. “We are also promoting the youth and gender. We have a young trainee priest, Sushmita Budyae, who will be conducting the prayers as well,” she said.Desai added that there were numerous spiritual benefits from participating in the prayer. “There are many benefits of participating or even listening to the mantras. You will feel energised and your mind will be revitalised. This is to remove all negative thoughts. The  smoke from the Hawan fire also cleanses the air and destroys the bacteria."
