Durban - So Chicken Licken has been forced to pull one of their adverts following a complaint that "it trivialises an issue that is triggering and upsetting for many South African people" and the Twitter streets were having none of it. Ok, if you have not seen the advert, it is a twist on the Jan van Riebeeck story.     When the hunger is too big to handle, that’s when the adventure begins 😬 #ConquerYourHunger🍔 #TheLegendOfBigJohn pic.twitter.com/M5gia84RS5 Now, after Sandile Cele, laid the complaint with the Advertising Regulatory Board, the popular fast food outlet had to pull the television ad. The advert has already been seen and shared thousands of times on social media. Here is what the Twitterverse had to say about the advert:     People try soo hard to be woke, niyabhora Maan. Brilliant ad chicken licken 👏 #LegendOfBigJohn     @ChickenLickenSA so the #LegendOfBigJohn ad has been banned because the minority that is claimed to be the majority was touched by it wow. Create another ad on the so called "majority" being touched by the ad for it to be banned to drive them even more crazy😂. Best Ad shame.     So the Chicken Licken ad has been banned? I missed the offense.     Brilliant!!! I have always thought we needed to make reverse images about oppression. It's not going to happen but just for a different perspective. Well done Chicken Licken! I'm going to have to buy some of that spicy chicken! Daily News
