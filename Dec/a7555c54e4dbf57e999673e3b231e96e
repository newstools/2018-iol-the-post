The couple, Nikesh Ramnath, 39, and Nerosha Persadh, 32, a teacher, were travelling along the N3 south-bound near Howick last Sunday evening when two vehicles collided. They sustained severe injuries and died at the scene, while their child was taken to hospital in a critical condition. Persadh’s cremation was on Tuesday and Ramnath’s was expected to go ahead later this week. Persadh’s sister Nerasha declined to comment. Shawn Herbst, of Netcare 911, said two light motor vehicles were involved in the collision. “Sadly, two adults from one of the light motor vehicles had died, a young child sustained serious injuries, and an adult male from the other light motor vehicle sustained head and spinal injuries.” Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of culpable homicide was opened at the Howick Police Station.
