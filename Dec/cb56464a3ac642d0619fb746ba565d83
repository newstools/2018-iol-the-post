Durban - A Durban family has turned to social media for answers after a relative was killed in a hit-and-run crash at the weekend. It is believed that the woman and three others were returning from getting their hair styled for a wedding later in the day when tragedy struck. The incident took place on the N2 northbound carriageway before the M1 Higginson Highway offramp. Rescue Care spokesperson, Garrith Jamieson, said by the time emergency services arrived at the scene, one person had already died. â€œRescue Care medics found the vehicle on its roof.
