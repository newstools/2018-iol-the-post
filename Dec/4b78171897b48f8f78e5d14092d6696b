Durban - The Reservoir Hills Ratepayers Association has started a petition calling for speed bumps to be erected on Mountbatten Drive and O’Flaherty Road in Clare Estate following a spate of the accidents. Chairperson of the association Ish Prahlad said in the last three years there have been more than 10 accidents on these roads. On Monday, a man was killed and three others were injured after two vehicles collided on Mountbatten Drive, near the Engen Garage. In November, Cole Calvin Kallee, 14, a Grade 9 pupil at Burnwood Secondary School, was hit by a car while walking to a church youth meeting on O'Flaherty Road. He sustained severe head injuries and died on his way to a hospital. "We have taken this issue up with the eThekwini Municipality previously and have been told that speed bumps cannot be erected on these roads because they were main roads for services vehicles like the ambulances and SAPS." But for Prahlad one death is too many. "We are hoping to get more than 5 000 signatures on the petition and the association will hand it over to Metro and the deputy mayor Fawzia Peer.  The authorities need to know we have had enough." Prahlad said petitions are available at the Reservoir Hills Mall, the Post Office and local services stations in the area. For more details call email ishprahlad@telkomsa.net or call 083 480 2955.
