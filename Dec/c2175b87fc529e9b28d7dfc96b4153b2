Durban - The top five summer health risks in SA are drowning, heat-related injuries, burns, breathing difficulties and bites and stings According to Russel Meiring spokesperson for ER24 these their what their teams are regularly called into action over the holiday season. “Watersports are a lot of fun,” says Meiring, “but if you or your children are not experienced in performing them safely and correctly, they can lead to accidents. It is essential that you ensure there is adequate supervision.” In SA, summer brings high temperatures and dry air: these can cause dehydration and allergy-related breathing issues, especially if you are unaccustomed to them, says Meiring. "Stay hydrated, be wary of staying outdoors too long, and watch children closely for signs of allergies." “Heatstroke is very common,” he says. “If left untreated, heat-related injuries can be serious and even lead to death.” Heat-related injuries will present in four categories: 1. Heat cramps (mild) 2. Heat cramps (intermediate) 3. Heat exhaustion and 4. Heatstroke (severe) “You can usually prevent heat injuries by staying hydrated,” Meiring says. However, knowing the signs of dehydration can help you prevent the problem from becoming dangerous. A child who is dehydrated will have: ● Dry mouth and tongue ● No tears when crying ● Less wet nappies than usual ● Sunken eyes, cheeks ● A sunken soft spot on top of skull (babies) ● A listless or irritable demeanour An adult suffering from dehydration will experience: ● Extreme thirst ● Less frequent urination ● Dark-coloured urine ● Fatigue ● Dizziness ● Confusion * There are different grades/degrees of dehydration and not all these signs have to be present. Obviously, the more severe cases will have more of the signs. Daily News
