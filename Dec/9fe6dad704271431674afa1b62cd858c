Durban - The case against five licence examiners from the Underberg and Howick testing stations, arrested for corruption, will continue next year.  The five, were arrested for allegedly assisting applicants to pass their tests for a fee. Hawks KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson, Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo, said the five appeared in the Durban Specialised Commercial Crime Court earlier today. "They were arrested last week Friday in joint operation by the Hawks’ Durban Serious Corruption Investigation, the National Traffic Anti-Corruption unit and Traffic and Transport Inspection unit. The matter was postponed to February 27, 2019," he said. The five were part of a larger group of 13 officials from licensing offices across the country. Mhlongo said the officials appeared in different courts following a nationwide clampdown on the fraudulent issuing of roadworthy certificates and drivers licenses. "The Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigation unit in collaboration with Road Traffic Management Corporation and Specialised Investigation unit arrested eight vehicle licencing officials aged between 30 and 43 in Thohoyandou and Musina respectively over the weekend for alleged corruption. The suspects stationed at Thusalushaka and Shayandima vehicle testing stations issued roadworthy certificates to motorists without examining the vehicles in return of gratifications," Mhlongo said.
