They, along with Mercedes owners, are more likely to rack up motoring offences and to make claims on their insurance than other drivers, British figures show. Top of the list are those behind the wheel of the BMW 420D, with around one in six (17%) having been convicted of speeding, jumping a red light or other motoring offences. And 21% of BMW 420D drivers have claimed on their insurance for an accident that was their fault, according to lists compiled by GoCompare Car Insurance. But there are also five different Mercedes models in the top 10 for convictions and four in the top 10 for “at fault” claims. Audi models also feature in lists dominated by German cars. At the other end of the scale, the drivers with the fewest motoring convictions, as well as at fault claims, are more likely to own less expensive cars. Drivers of the Peugeot 206 have the lowest rate of at fault insurance claims (8.5%). Matt Oliver, of GoCompare Car Insurance, said: “While it may be no surprise that higher-powered, luxury cars are the marques of choice for some of the more dangerous drivers on the road, it’s not true of all owners of these makes.”
