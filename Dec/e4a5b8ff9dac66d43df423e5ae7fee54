Durban - A 38-year-old suspect who evaded police since 2005 was arrested during an intelligence-driven operation on Wednesday in the Isipingo CBD. According to police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala, the suspect was wanted for various cases of fraud, possession of unlicensed firearm, pointing of a firearm, theft and driving under the influence of intoxicating substance dating from 2005 to 2016. Police officers attached to the Provincial Trio Task Team made the arrest. According to Gwala, the suspect was previously convicted for fraud and theft. "He failed to return to court and a warrant for his arrest was issued at court." The suspect is expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court. In a separate operation, a 50-year-old was arrested in at a farm in Camperdown for allegedly being in illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. Gwala said he will be appearing in the Camperdown Magistrate's Court. "The suspect was found in possession of a pistol and ammunition. Investigations reveal that the firearm was licensed and belonged to someone who has never reported it missing. Detectives will focus their investigations to determine if these men can be linked to any pending case of serious and violent crimes," said Gwala. Daily News
