Rescue Care operations director Garrith Jamieson said parents should be careful with children near water. “Please keep all eyes on children while they are in your care,” Jamieson said. He said they were called out to the drowning incident on the Berea at about 2pm on Friday. When paramedics arrived, they were met by relatives of the 3-year-old who had drowned in the family swimming pool. “Paramedics assessed the child and unfortunately there were no signs of life and nothing further could be done for the girl. “She was declared dead at the scene,” Jamieson said. He said the incident was being investigated by police. In another incident, after a four-day search, police recovered the body of a 22-year-old man who had drowned at North Beach. Mbele said the body was recovered from the shorebreak at the Bay of Plenty on Saturday morning by search and rescue team members. An inquest docket has been opened at the Durban Central police station. Officials said more than 276132 people had visited various city beaches from December 18 to 20. More than 20 rescues were carried out and 156 people received first-aid treatment, mostly for blue-bottle stings and minor cuts. More than 500 children were separated from their parents or guardians, while Beach Buddies and Childminders handed out 19044 wristbands during the week. The acting chairperson of the municipality’s Festive Season Management Committee, Malcolm Canham, urged parents and guardians to be vigilant in ensuring that children were kept within sight and were safe at all times. “Beachgoers should only swim within designated bathing areas, marked with red and yellow flagged beacons. “Swimming hours are strictly from 6am to 6.30pm. “The public may not swim at night, nor should they swim at beaches that are not manned by lifeguards,” said Canham.
