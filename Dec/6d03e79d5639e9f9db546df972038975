Durban - KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health MEC, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, will this week visit the family of Sister Nothando Biyela who was shot during an apparent robbery in Melmoth at the weekend. Biyela, 46, was at home when three men entered her house in Nkwenkwe on Saturday night. The men shot Biyela and made off with her car. She was rushed to the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital where she died yesterday. Biyela, who had worked for the department since November 1, 2000, was described by her colleagues as a very mature and hard working nurse. She is said to have loved her job, always advocating for her patients and putting them first. She had started as an orderly within the laundry unit, working under the diocese attached to the church. She then worked her way up and received training as an enrolled nurse before furthering her studies to eventually become a professional nurse. She was working in the male ward at the time of her death. Dhlomo described the incident as ‘a real tragedy’. “The murder of Sister Biyela is sad as we have just emerged from our campaign against femicide and other forms of gender-based violence, through the 16 Days of Activism for no Violence Against Women and Children. You just know that something has gone terribly wrong in society when three men gang up against one woman, shoot her and take away a disposable material possession such as a car. It becomes a shock to the system because nothing can ever be equated to the value of human life. It is even worse when we lose a healthcare worker because these are people who’ve been sent by the Almighty God himself, to preserve and save lives. So, this is shocking and devastating, and we are praying for the Almighty to grant her family strength during this difficult time. We hope the police will make an arrest soon," Dhlomo said. Daily News
