Durban - Two people, one of them a female toddler was killed in a head-on collision between a bakkie and light motor vehicle on the R617 in Bulwer, KwaZulu Natal. According to ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring ten people were injured and taken to various hospital following the accident on Thursday morning just after 10am. "ER24 paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene to find the bakkie on its side while the light motor vehicle was found upright next to the bakkie," said Meiring. He said several people were found lying scattered around the scene. "Upon closer inspection, paramedics found a man lying trapped inside the driverâ€™s seat of the light motor vehicle while a girl, believed to have been two-years-old, was found lying on the road side. "Both patients had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for the male patient and he was declared dead. The young girl was treated and provided with CPR and advanced life support interventions. Unfortunately, after some time, no vital signs returned and the girl was declared dead a short time later." Meiring said ten other patients were assessed and found to have sustained minor to moderate injuries. The details surrounding this incident are not yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations. Daily News
