Nezeera, 15, a Grade 7 pupil at Morelands Primary School, fired a single shot to her head at her home in Moorton on November 23. She had watched YouTube videos on her cellphone about how to use a gun. Her guardian and uncle, Ravi Reddy, said the family were hoping police investigations would give them answers as to how she acquired a gun. He believed she was suffering from depression after the death of her mother, Zora. “Her mother died four years ago and Nezeera struggled to deal with her death. She ended her life on Friday, a day after her mother’s birthday.” Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said they were awaiting the results of the ballistic tests. “They will determine who the firearm belonged to, therefore enabling us to investigate further.” POST
