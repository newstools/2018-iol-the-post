He had the most curious little mind and when he set his mind to something, nothing could stand in his way. He taught himself to ride his bike and potty-trained himself. He just simply decided he wanted to be a big boy. He would send Tess and I bizarre shopping lists. One day he asked for clear silicone, corn flour and food colouring so he could make little silicone LEGO figures in moulds! He was a budding artist and could draw incredibly well. When he started Grade 1, he came home crying one day. It was because his teacher had not realised how well he could read and did not let him get books from the “big boy side” of the library. From the time he was a baby, he had an incredibly gifted ear. He would sit at the piano when he could barely reach the keyboard, and plonk away. The first little piece he played with both hands was a simplified arrangement of Grieg’s In the hall of the Mountain King from the Peer Gynt Suite when he was six. He had a keen sense of fashion (not from me, obviously) and wanted to look great for each occasion. How he knew what went with what escapes me, but he would wear unusual things like bow ties, braces and beret caps and make them look awfully stylish! Learning from his big brother he became obsessed with soccer in the last few years. Being Beanie, he would find something that suited him and wouldn’t follow the herd - he wanted to be a goalie. He would practice his goals every day with his brother. He had several goalie kits and his wish-list when I was in the UK was for the Manchester United kids’ goalie set. It was exactly what I was looking for when I received the call that there was an accident and had to immediately make arrangements to return home. My baby soccer player passed away in his goals in the end doing what he absolutely loved the most. It was a cruel and merciless ending for his beautiful life. He will never be forgotten by anyone who knew him.' * This is an edited version of the tribute. POST
