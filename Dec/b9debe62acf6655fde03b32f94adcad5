Durban - The Department of Health in KwaZulu-Natal has 300 vacant posts to fill. They are inviting Enrolled Nurses and Enrolled Nursing Assistants to apply for the vacant posts. There will be a job assessment programme hosted on Wednesday in Cato Manor. Candidates are required to arrive on the sports fields opposite Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital early on Wednesday, in time for the assessment. They will then be transported to two venues at 9am, where they will be required to write an examination to assess their professional knowledge and suitability to be considered for employment by the department. The 300 available posts are for 150 Enrolled Nurses and 150 Enrolled Nursing Assistants, and not any other nursing categories. This process is only open to candidates who have never been permanently employed. Candidates are required to bring: ·       Certified copies of their Identity Documents; ·       Certified copies of matric certificate and nursing qualification; and ·       Certified Proof of Registration with the South African Nursing Council -  and proof of the latest payment thereof. Candidates will be transported free of charge to the writing venues and back. They will only be allowed to complete one Z83 form, as each person may only apply for one post. The requisite safety and security arrangements for a gathering of this nature have been put in place. The department wishes to urge all candidates not to fall for fraudulent adverts that may be circulated on mobile electronic messaging platforms (except for the department’s official Facebook page), which may ask them to pay for posts. No government post is ever paid for, as this constitutes criminal activity. Daily News
