“It's going to be generally warm, but we expect light rain in the late afternoon to evening,” said forecaster Wiseman Dlamini yesterday. He said they are also expecting partly cloudy conditions, but temperatures in Durban and surrounding areas are expected to reach up to 28ºC. “Over the northern interior, in places such as Greytown and Estcourt, it will be very hot, reaching between 32ºC and 35ºC,” he said. Dlamini said wind speeds of 10-15 knots - not too strong - could be expected in Durban and the north coast towards Richards Bay, blowing in a north-easterly direction, and five knots in a south-easterly direction inland. Meanwhile, the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa has announced that passenger trains will not be running on Christmas Day. However, Prasa spokesperson Zama Nomnganga said that trains would run on January 1 because of people taking religious journeys and heading to the beaches. Monthly train tickets would be sold from January 2. Daily News
