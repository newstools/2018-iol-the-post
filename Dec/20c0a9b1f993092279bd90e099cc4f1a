It is believed that Lotus fm station manager Alvin Pillay was suspended on Friday. He has been named as one of the alleged perpetrators of sexual harassment. Pillay refused to comment and referred all questions to the SABC. Two sources told POST Pillay had not reported for duty since Monday, fuelling suspicions he had been suspended. SABC group executive for Human Resources Jonathan Thekiso said, to date, five people had been suspended, and more were expected. “This is only phase one; it is to deal with the ­recommendations of the commission. Phase two will deal with SABC employees who were complicit and turned a blind eye to sexual harassment.” On Thursday, Lotus fm traffic presenter Sanobar Khan quit the station citing the unprofessional way matters were handled and the partiality that currently exists at the station. “As an advocate for mental health and gender equality in the workplace, the toxic culture is simply no longer conducive, which is why I have chosen to leave,” said Khan. The commission, chaired by Barbara Watson, released its report early last month. The inquiry found that management and unions at the SABC trivialised complaints, with the human resources department ignoring the implementation of the corporation’s sexual harassment policy. POST
