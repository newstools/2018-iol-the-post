Durban - Nine car guards have been taken to the Berea Police station along with their employer for not being registered with the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority(PSIRA) on Monday The nine men, all foreign nationals, along with their employer, Perfect Parking, were arrested at the Windemere centre on Monday. They were arrested during a sting operation following a number of complaints the authority received from police in relation to car jamming at malls. At the moment the men and their employer, a South African woman, are being questioned at the Berea Police station. Their PSIRA documentation is apparently fraudulent, it is not yet clear whether they are in the country illegally or not. Ahead of the sting operation PSIRA regional manager Talent Zwane said all car guards are meant to be registered with PSIRA. She said after registration they are issued with a certificate and identity card from PSIRA. "The card is small and white, it has a PSIRA logo on it with their ID number as well as a PSIRA number," she said. She said during their registration process fingerprints of the applicant are taken to check for a criminal record. One of the car guards arrested at the Windemere Centre was found to have a fraudulent PSIRA certificate that reflected the details of a South African female with a criminal record. Daily News
