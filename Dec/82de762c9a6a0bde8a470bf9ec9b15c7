Durban - JITHIN Ramjaewan will be spending Christmas behind bars. The 37-year-old accused of murdering Merebank pensioner, Dhanwathie Fakira, at her home on November 25, appeared at the Durban Magistrates Court today for his bail application. He initially appeared in court for his bail application at the beginning of December but it was denied. The 79-year-old's body was discovered battered and stabbed on the bathroom floor of her Arcot Place home by her nephew and his wife. She allegedly named him as her murderer before dying. Ramjaewan, from Phoenix, who had been renting at her home at the time, made a brief appearance today. Outstanding statements forced the court to remand his case until next year. Scores of people using red t-shirts with the grandmothers face on it filled the courtroom today. Members from the Isipingo Community Policing Forum, the Merebank Policing Forum and the Freedom over Capitalist Communism organisations joined family and friends at court this morning. Before Ramjaewan’s appearance, they protested outside the court chanting the words, “no bail.” POST
