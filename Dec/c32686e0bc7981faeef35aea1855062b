Durban - If you closed your eyes for a minute and stood in the Durban suburb of Montclair this past weekend, you would think you were in a scene from the Fast and Furious meets Wild Wild West. It is alleged that those close to a well-known criminal took to the streets to ‘celebrate’ his life by speeding up and down the road and firing gun shots into the air. It is unclear when or how the man died. Residents in Montclair have taken to social media to express their utter disgust at the events that took place over the weekend. In two clips, which have gone viral on social media, there are people racing cars in the background.     “Thank goodness we moved out of that area! How is one supposed to raise a family when you have idiots crashing cars into each other and gunshots going off!” a resident said. Another said, "And this is entertaining? He could have killed them or himself. He should be charged. What is happening to our society?" Last year, similar scenes played out following the death of notorious hijacker, Sandile Chillies Bhengu. No cases were reported to police. Daily News
