Durban - A Durban businessman was hijacked just minutes after he arrived at his premises in Silverglen, Chatsworth on Tuesday morning. The man, along with his neighbour, were found in W section in uMlazi a short while later. According to the man’s brother, who asked not to be named, the businessman had arrived at his factory after 6am. “My brother was unlocking the premises when the man across the road called him and they got into a conversation. They noticed a car driving towards them but did not think anything of it. As the car approached, some men got out of the car and walked towards my brother and the neighbour,” the man said. He said his brother’s vehicle was taken. According to Blue Security’s Andreas Mathios, the suspects dropped the motorist and his passenger off in W Section, near the fire station about an hour later. “The vehicle was recovered in Z Section. The suspects got away with keys and a cellphone,” Mathios said. He advised residents to to be vigilant when entering or exiting driveways - which are hotspots for hijackings - especially early in the morning and in the evening. “Make sure that any overgrown bushes and trees have been trimmed so they can’t serve as hiding places for criminals to lie in wait for you. Be aware of your surroundings at all times, especially as you approach your property,” Mathios said. “If you notice any suspicious individuals or vehicles lurking near your property or suspect that someone may be following you, rather drive around the block and if the suspicious individuals are still there don’t open the gate. Rather drive to your nearest police station and contact your security company for assistance,” Mathios said. “Now that the festive season is fast approaching it is important to be extra vigilant and to remember to be security conscious and not let down your guard during the holidays," he added.
