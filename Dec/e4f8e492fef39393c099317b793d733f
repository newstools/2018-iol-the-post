Durban  - KZN MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs Sihle Zikalala is pleased that Sodwana Bay Guest Lodge owner Andre Slade lost his appeal and is guilty of hate speech. Zikalala said no tourist should be racially-profiled or treated otherwise on the basis of their race. Slade was found guilty in the Equality Court in February 2018 following his utterances in June 2016 that white people were superior to black people and fined R50 000, payable to a charity. In his capacity as MEC Zikalala immediately laid charges against Slade and his partner. Slade also refused to accommodate black tourists and patrons in his business facility, saying he believed they were created to be servants. Slade took the matter on appeal stating that the magistrate had been emotional and did not understand his religious contentions. However, the decision was upheld. “Slade’s conduct can never be tolerated in a democratic society," said Sikalala. "We welcome the findings and we hope this will send a strong message to anyone with intentions to taint our renowned tourism industry or anyone hell-bent on polarizing our society,” said Zikalala. “This is why this court judgment is critical to us as it sends out a strong message that KwaZulu-Natal especially and South Africa, in particular, have no place for people who want to take us back to a period where certain recreational facilities and amenities were the preserve of a certain race at the detriment of others.’’ Daily News
