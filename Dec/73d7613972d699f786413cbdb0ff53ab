Durban - Mohammed Ebrahim, the man in the dock for the murder of Miguel Louw, said when he heard that Miguel was missing, he thought it was a hoax. Ebrahim appeared in the Durban Regional Court on Wednesday and was cross-examined by State Prosecutor Kuveshnie Pillay. In court, Ebrahim admitted to having seen Miguel on July 17. He added that later in the day, he was told that Miguel's mother Raylene Louw, had contacted to ask about Miguel. Ebrahim told the court that he told her that Miguel should be at home and suggested she go to the police station for assistance. During his cross-examination, Ebrahim maintained that he and Raylene had been in a relationship. He told the court that he had lived at the Louw home for more than two months. He said he did odd jobs around the house. The State claimed that after his arrest and subsequent release (on bail) that Ebrahim contacted Raylene. Ebrahim said this was not true. Following a lengthy cross-examination, Pillay said Ebrahim was evasive in his answers. She added that he is a dishonest witness and tells the court he is a flight risk. Pillay adds that bail should not be granted. Ebrahim was then cross-examined by his lawyer, Chris Gounden. * The matter continues in court. Daily News
