Durban  - The murder trial of murdered Bluff mother Bianca Parsons is expected to begin in January. Parsons was shot dead on February 26 while seated in her car at the Engine garage in Wentworth. Darryl Morrison, 33, and Christopher Houston, 26, were arrested and charged for murder. They appeared in the Durban High Court on Monday where the trial date was finalised and set down from January 28 until February 14. They are being represented by attorney Ridewaan Sayed. Both men will ring in the New year behind bars as their bail application in May was denied. The men were arrested after CCTV camera footage allegedly linked them to the crime. The Daily News reported that Morrison who lives in Wentworth told the Durban Magistrate's Court that he was sorry. He said that he had mistaken Parsons for another woman when the trigger was pulled. Parsons was killed in the presence of her daughter. Daily News
