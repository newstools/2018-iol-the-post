Durban - The Verulam man accused of raping his stepdaughter 900 times over a period of five years will appear in the Verulam Family Court in January. The man, 43, appeared in court via video link from prison and the case was adjourned to January 11 for further investigation. The 10-year-old girl will be interviewed for the second time during the school holiday, according to the State's request. The man who was arrested in June faces charges of sexual grooming, exposure of a child to pornography, sexual assault, and child neglect. Prosecutor San Bhartu said the girl claimed in an interview she had been raped every second day. He is being represented by Legal Aid SA. In July Chief magistrate Irfaan Khalil refused bail on the basis that the accused was found to be a threat to society and to the child. The child remains in a place of safety. Daily News
