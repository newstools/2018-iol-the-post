Durban - Convicted murderer Rajivee Soni will spend Christmas and New Years behind bars. Soni, who was convicted and jailed for 30 years for the 2013 murder of Pietermaritzburg doctor Bhavish Sewram appeared in the Durban High Court this week. He made an application for leave to appeal his conviction. Arguments began and the matter was adjourned to March 7. Soni remains behind bars at New Prison in Pietermaritzburg. He apparently masterminded the doctor's murder because he suspected he was having an affair with his wife. He enlisted the help of former policeman Brian Treasurer, who was convicted to life imprisonment and died in jail. Soni was convicted on various counts - 25 years for murder; 5 years for defeating the course of justice; 18 months for assault and 5 years for conspiracy to commit murder.Â The judge ruled that the sentences would run concurrently and jailed Soni to an effective 30 years.
