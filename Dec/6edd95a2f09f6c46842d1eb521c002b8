Durban - Shackdweller movement, Abahlali baseMjondolo, is ready to head back to court. This time they are hoping to secure an order to prevent ongoing evictions in Cato Crest. The group said these evictions have been taking place over the last six months. "Last week, more than 46 homes were demolished and three were burnt down by the land invasion unit. There was no court order and this was, therefore, another illegal attack on the occupation. This occupation has not come easy as many people have been injured after being shot with live ammunition by the unit, the group claimed. Abahlali baseMjondolo'sÂ Thapelo Mohapi, said on Sunday at around 8pm one of the participants in the occupation, and a leader in the protests organised to defend the occupation, Senzo Gumede, was shot and killed by unknown men in a nearby area. "Senzo was vocal against those who opposed the occupation. He took a leading role in organising the road blockades used to defend the occupation when it was under attack. He had been threatened by the ward councillor in the area, and, on a number of occasions, he was also threatened by taxi owners who said that the road blockades were hampering their business," Mohapi said. He said the group will go to court on Thursday. "We want to ensure that the rights of the impoverished and marginalised cannot be grossly violated with impunity," he said. Daily News
