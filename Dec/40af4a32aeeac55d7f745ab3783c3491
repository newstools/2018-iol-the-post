KwaZulu-Natal’s Transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda has praised the Westville police officers who arrested two of their own who tried to extort a bribe from a truck driver. The police officers aged 31 and 42, were arrested while on duty on Wednesday. They had allegedly pulled a truck over at Essex Terrace in Westville and upon searching it, they found the disc had expired. Kaunda applauded the police: “As government, we strongly condemn all forms of crime, especially if it is committed by the people who are the custodians of law enforcement. This arrest will send a strong message to other rogue police officers that corruption will not be tolerated in the service”. “They were arrested and charged for bribery and corruption.  Their firearms were immediately removed from their possession for safekeeping and they were detained in the cells at the Westville police station,” he said. Police said the two allegedly demanded cash. “The truck driver contacted his employer asking him to deposit the cash by e-wallet. The police officers then drove to a local mall with the truck driver to withdraw the money,” said KZN police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker. The employer alerted police at the Westville police station about the ordeal and the police immediately responded and apprehended the suspects at the mall as they allegedly attempted to withdraw the cash.
