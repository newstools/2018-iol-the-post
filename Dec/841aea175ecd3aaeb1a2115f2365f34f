Businessmen Seelan Govender, his brother Polo Govender and son-in-law Shalen Ramdass from Richards Bay were burnt to death after a collision between their Mercedes-Benz and a minibus taxi. Since Saturday and at the start of the festive season, there have been 22 road fatalities in the province. The Department of Transport, Community Safety and Liaison has asked a team of investigators and forensic experts to establish the cause of the deadly crash. “We will send a team of engineers to conduct an assessment along the stretch of road to establish if additional safety measures are required,” said the KwaZulu-Natal MEC Mxolisi Kaunda. He has instructed law enforcement officers to clamp down on reckless drivers. Kaunda said that the crashes would not deter the province from its commitment to reduce road crashes and fatalities by more than 10% during the festive season and beyond. “We launched an integrated safety plan which focuses on high law enforcement visibility in all hazardous spots in the province. We are going to clamp down on drinking and driving, speeding unroadworthy vehicles and unlicensed drivers,” said Kaunda. He said road safety was a collective responsibility and called on the people of KwaZulu-Natal, particularly road users, to work with the government in order to reduce crashes. “We will win the battle against fatal crashes if we work together and speak in one voice that road crashes should not be part of our lives,” Kaunda said. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said 15 passengers burnt beyond recognition and four were badly injured. “The injured were taken to hospital for medical attention. Charges of culpable homicide were opened at Empangeni police station for investigation.” The deceased families declined to comment. POST
