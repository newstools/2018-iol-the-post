Durban - Your Uber trip will now cost you 50 cents extra per kilometre. Recently, the e-hailing taxi service announced that they would be increasing their pricing, effective immediately. The increase comes on the back of a decrease in the petrol price. In a statement, Uber said, “For riders, the new fare pricing means that we can invest even more in the technology features that make your Uber experience a seamless one. With the introduction of new safety tools in the Uber app, you’re able to enjoy every ride with more peace of mind to keep you connected and protected. From emergency assistance, rider insurance coverage and trusted contacts – we’re committed to your safety from pick-up to drop-off.” Uber added that while they have always tried to keep prices as low as possible, they need to be aware of the increased costs for driver partners. “ After implementing an in-depth earnings review to ensure that the Uber app continues to be a reliable economic opportunity for drivers, as well as an affordable option for riders, we’ve chosen to increase fares by 5% in South Africa from December 7,”  Uber said. The service provider added that they believed that this small increase will still make it possible for riders to access affordable transport whilst providing better earnings for driver-partners.
