Durban - A week after an off-duty policeman shot dead his estranged wife and her brother at the Durban Magistrate's Court there has been a ban on guns in the courthouse. On Monday morning  Deputy Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development John Jeffery visited the Durban Magistrate's Court and announced that security had been tightened. On November 28, Sergeant Phumlani Chiliza shot dead Dibuseng Chiliza, 33, along with Gert Remoratile Moss in O court where divorce cases are heard. He died later that night after turning the gun on himself. According to East Coast Radio Newswatch Jeffrey said no person can bring a gun into court. "Unless they are a court orderely; that would be a policeman who is assigned to a court to ensure that there is safety in that courtroom, but nobody else." He added that there were gun safes in the entrances of the court that can be used for firearms. Daily News
