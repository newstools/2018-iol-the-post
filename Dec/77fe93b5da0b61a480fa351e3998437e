Father of one Ronaldo Chetty, 30, was arrested and charged with fraud after he allegedly conned a grandmother, 72, into handing over the 50-year-old necklace worth about R50000, a cellphone and R700 cash. Chetty allegedly approached the Durban North woman at La Lucia Mall, under the pretence of knowing her son, on October 24. He was arrested at his home a day later. In his affidavit, the investigating officer, Warrant Officer Yoganathan Govender, opposed bail. The court heard that Chetty faced eight other fraud charges using a similar modus operandi. In January, Chetty allegedly conned an elderly man into handing over R2500 for a parcel and, in March, he conned an elderly woman of R200 and three gold bangles. Another victim had allegedly given him R1500 for “computer stuff” that he needed for her son. He is alleged to have driven her in a white BMW to withdraw the money, of which R70 was handed to her to buy two plastic bags to carry the “stuff”. When she returned, he could not be found. The complainants identified Chetty by his gold teeth and face tattoo. The accused had previously been convicted on three counts of theft, for two of which he was sentenced to three months imprisonment suspended for three years, and fined R800. Govender added that Chetty preyed on those between 60 and 80 years old. “The fact that the applicant mentioned their children owed money broke their hearts. They quietly withdrew the money from ATMs, or had the cash in their possession and paid the applicant.” In his affidavit, Chetty, who is self-employed and earns R7000 a month, said he was his family’s breadwinner. The matter was adjourned to January. POST
