POLICE have opened an inquest into the deaths of Selvan Pillay and his mother Thanalutchmee Durugan. Last week Pillay’s body was found at the Silverglen Nature Reserve. Pillay and his 68-year-old paraplegic mother had been missing for several days. They had gone missing at the end of November. Durugan’s body was found first, in a dam at the Silverglen nature reserve. Pillay allegedly gave money to a neighbour to pay for his mother’s funeral. His vehicle, a Toyota Corolla, was then spotted at the reserve a day before his body was found. In a letter, seen by POST, Pillay wrote that he had more than R500 000 in a Nedbank account and did not have a will, so those who intended on getting his money would have to “fight the battle” for it. He also confirmed he had left R20 000 with a neighbour, on November 22 at 5pm, which was meant for his mother’s funeral expenses. POST
