Durban - One person has been killed and another seriously injured following a crash on Inanda Road and Sea Cow Lake Road on Tuesday night. Rescue Care paramedics spokesperson Garrith Jamieson said paramedics arrived on scene to find that a single vehicle had lost control before colliding into a concrete barrier. "A male believed to be in his thirties was found to have sustained fatal injuries and unfortunately there was nothing more paramedics could do for him. He was declared deceased on the scene." Jamieson said a second person sustained serious injuries and was stabilised on the scene before being transported to a nearby Durban hospital for the further care that he required. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said the crash was being investigated. He said a case of culpable homicide had been opened. Zwane urged motorists to be careful and vigilant on the roads especially during the festive season. POST
