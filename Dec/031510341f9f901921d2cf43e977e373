Durban - Christmas came early for The Open Door Crisis Care Centre in Pinetown when it was fitted with a new security system. The Centre Director Thora Mansfield, said the organisation, which assists victims of child abuse, domestic violence and human trafficking, had been hit by burglars constantly. The centre water pipes were also stolen. “They came through the ceiling, they came through the door, they made a big hole through the wall, they came underneath the floor. On one occasion they made a hole through a nine-inch wall and they must have sat there for hours. They came in and stole about R10 000 worth of toiletries that we had just bought for all our shelters and they took a laptop,” Mansfield said. The centre approached Blue Security a few months ago to improve the organisation’s security and Blue Angels stepped forward to donate a state of the art smart alarm system, complete with external beams and CCTV cameras. “They have given us an amazing amount of security and put in a really amazing system.  It has made an enormous difference to us and we feel so much safer externally and also internally because of all our panic buttons,” Mansfield said Blue Angel's trustee and Blue Security marketing director Darren Lategan said the crises centre is a valuable asset to the province and city because of the work they carry out. "We were able to assist such a worthy organisation so that they can feel safer as they go about their core business helping victims of crime,” Lategan said. Daily News
