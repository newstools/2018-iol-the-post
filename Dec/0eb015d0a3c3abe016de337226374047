Just after 10am, emergency teams were dispatched to Chelsea Avenue where the building was well alight. eThekwini Fire divisional commander, Dennis Govender, said when they arrived they managed to contain the blaze, preventing it from spreading to other nearby buildings. He said they also evacuated staff from surrounding premises. “The plant manufactures car by-products and had a high volume of base oil, which is highly flammable. The landlord had recently hired construction workers who were busy with the roof of the property. It is suspected a spark from an angle grinder fell onto the ground or perhaps a hot bolt from the roof fell and sparked the fire.” Govender said using foam tenders and water carriers, fire teams were able to extinguish the fire. He added that two cars were burnt in the blaze. Govender said firefighters then worked alongside environmental teams to ensure that the water used to douse the blaze did not contaminate nearby water sources. Rescue Care spokesperson Garrith Jamieson said no injuries were reported. The road, which had been closed to traffic, was opened three hours later. Se-Anne Rall
