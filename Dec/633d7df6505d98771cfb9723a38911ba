Durban - One of the men arrested for the hijacking and abduction of a woman in Morningside last week, will remain behind bars pending his formal bail application. Asibonge Mdlalose appeared briefly in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. He faces charges of robbery with aggravating circumstances and kidnapping.

The men approached Rubilar and one of them grabbed her handbag and cell phone. She was pushed back towards her car and bundled into the back seat. One of the men then drove off in Ribular's car. The entire ordeal was captured on CCTV cameras and the footage went viral. A search was then initiated for Rubilar who was found less than four hours later. She was located in the Newlands area. She was unharmed. Her vehicle was also recovered a short while later. Mdlalose's accomplices are still at large. Daily News
