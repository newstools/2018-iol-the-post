Durban - Miguel Louw murder accused, Mohammed Ebrahim, maintained that he and the boy's mother were in a relationship. Ebrahim appeared in the Durban Regional Court on a charge of murder on Wednesday.     Kidnapping and theft charges have been withdrawn against him. He was arrested at the Durban Magistrate's Court last week. On the day that Miguel was allegedly kidnapped, Ebrahim said he was waiting to take a taxi to go home. According to Ebrahim, there was no food prepared at home for Miguel and he offered to buy him chips. He said Miguel then asked for KFC. The pair were then spotted on CCTV footage at the eatery. It is alleged that Miguel later boarded a taxi and that was the last time the boy was seen near his home.             The Mercury
