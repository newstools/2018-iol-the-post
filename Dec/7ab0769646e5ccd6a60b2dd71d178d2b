Durban - A Pinetown resident has pleaded guilty to charges of animal cruelty after his dog, Boyz, was found chained at his property by members of the Kloof & Highway SPCA. However, due to the pain and suffering endured by Boyz, he had to be put down. Last month, the SPCA’s Inspector Petra Abrams arrived at the Pinetown home to find the animal tied to a chain, not longer than one metre. “Boyz had been left with no water or shelter. The chain had left a deep wound on the dog’s neck and it was infected.  Dr Mary-Anne Anderson, our Veterinarian from the Kloof & Highway SPCA, who examined Boyz, advised that he had been suffering so severely over an extended period of time, that the most humane decision would be to humanely euthanase him,” Abrams said. Inspectorate Manager Sue Noakes said Boyz’s suffering and the extent of his wounds were sadly just too severe for him to be rehabilitated to be rehomed which saddened all staff involved as everyone wanted Boyz to be given a second chance to experience love from an owner. “That made us fight so much harder to obtain justice for his suffering and give him a voice,” she said. The case has been remanded for sentencing and a request for denial of ownership was submitted. However, after a number of court appearances, the owner pleaded guilty. The SPCA has thanked those members of the community who alerted them to the matter and the magistrate who ensured justice was achieved. The Mercury
