The summit was put together by the management of the Phoenix SAPS after residents had written to Minister of Police Bheki Cele, about their fears and concerns. But Station Commander Brigadier Bafana Ndlovu said police time and resources were being wasted because officers were attending to almost 15 complaints of domestic violence. Sharing the station’s crime statistics from April to October this year, Ndlovu said the number one crime reported by residents was assault common. “With the assault common cases 99% of the time it is linked to domestic violence. This is where our time and resources are spent. The second highest crime reported was housebreaking, followed by robbery with aggravating circumstances, theft of motor vehicles and assault GBH.” Ndlovu said the station had 76 detectives and a vehicle fleet of 73. “At any given time, detectives are on their annual leave or sick leave. From the fleet of vehicles, 38 are used by detectives and 28 by visible policing.” Natasha Naidoo, the sister of Donovan Naicker, who was murdered near their home in Stonebridge, claimed she had written 30 emails to the minister requesting help for her brother’s murder. “I was getting nowhere with SAPS in Phoenix. Even when my brother died, we waited 45 minutes for police to come to the scene. The security companies were much faster. The way they conducted the investigation into my brother’s murder was shoddy. ” Resident Sharon Munien accused police of being corrupt . “We see police officers in police vehicles parked in front of drug lords homes collecting money from them. By doing this, police are giving power to the drug lords to over-ride the community.” Ndlovu advised residents who find police officers colluding with drug lords to acquire tangible evidence before reporting the matter so that the officer could be arrested and prosecuted.
