Durban - A Durban man used Facebook to trace two people who allegedly bought a car using his name and hand them over to police. The suspects, aged 24, are facing charges of fraud and are expected to make their first appearance in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Thursday. According to police spokesperson Lt Colonel Thulani Zwane the 36-year-old victim made the discovery when he made an application to buy a house. "His application was turned down because it appeared that he owned a second vehicle which was still under finance. "The victim was surprised as he did not own a second vehicle. He then began his own investigation by obtaining copies of documentation allegedly used to buy the vehicle from a car dealership at uMhlanga Rocks. Zwane said the man then opened a case of fraud at Durban North police station. "The victim managed to trace the alleged suspects on Facebook andÂ apprehended both on Florida Road, Durban. "He took them to his house at KwaMashu Hostel while waiting for the third suspect to arrive. The third suspect did not pitch up and he decided to hand over the two suspects to Durban North police." Zwane said the two suspects were reported as having been kidnapped but that case was since closed. Daily News
