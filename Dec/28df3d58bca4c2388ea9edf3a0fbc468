Durban - The Cannabis Developing Council of South Africa (CDCSA) has revealed that KZN will be home to the world's largest licensed commercial Cannabis Sativa cultivation. Following closely from the legalisation of cannabis in the country, CDSA chairperson, Krithi Thaver said they have made significant progress to have Cannabis Sativa cultivated and are excited about this big step. "Having engaged with the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture at aÂ national level, permits were issued to cultivate this once vilified plant. This plant plays a major role in South Africa with our current status as it will have a major impact on the economy, as well as the creation of jobs and taking care of the public housing and healthcare issues," said Thaver. Cannabis Sativa is a type of cannabis that contains bioactive cannabinoids that have over 50 000 uses from the production of textiles, biofuels, biodegradable plastics and medicinal products. Thaver said CDSA has over the years built mass support and through a non-exclusionary process, members will be given access all the benefits available through the industry that will be created from Cannabis Sativa. The farm is 5 000 hectares and is based in Newcastle. Viewing of the land to be cultivated will take place on Wednesday via helicopter. POST
