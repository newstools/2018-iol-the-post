Durban - ELEVEN members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) were found guilty of assaulting a 17-year-old Congolese citizen. The assault took place in Mbuji-Mayi in the Kasai Oriental province, of the Democratic Republic of the Congo(DRC) in January. SANDF members had been deployed as part of the Force Intervention Brigade (FIB) of Operation MISTRAL. Three South African soldiers had caught the minor, who was suspected of stealing plastic basins and buckets belonging to South African soldiers. He was taken inside the military base where he was assaulted. He had sustained a minor wound as a result. The case was immediately reported to the authorities for a full-scale investigation. Following a trial, 11 of the original 16 accused were convicted. Five of the accused were acquitted. The members were found guilty of common law assault. SANDF chief, General Solly Shoke, said he welcomed the speedy trial and successful conviction of those guilty of assault and tarnishing the good name of the SANDF Peacekeepers in the DRC. He reiterated that the SANDF will never tolerate crime or criminals in its ranks and will at all times act against those who display this behaviour. POST
