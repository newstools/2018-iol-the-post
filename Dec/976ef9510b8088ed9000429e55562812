Durban - A Durban Jehovah’s Witness couple who were challenged in court by the KZN Health MEC after they refused to allow their chronically ill son to have a blood transfusion are expected to file answering affidavits in the Durban High Court on Wednesday. Despite a court order instructing that the 5-year-old, who suffers from sickle cell anaemia be given the blood transfusion if necessary, the parents were adamant that they believed in an alternative medical approach. The urgent application was brought on September 28 by Dr Noxolo Mbadi, head of Paediatrics at Addington Hospital, and KZN Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo, 10 days after the child was admitted to hospital. Mbadi said if the boy did not receive the blood transfusion he could suffer a stroke or die. The couple, who are hearing impaired, spoke to POST through their translator, Silas Ngetar. Ngetar said despite the court order, the boy had not been given the transfusion. He said the parents’ decision was based not on cowardice but on biblical principles. POST
