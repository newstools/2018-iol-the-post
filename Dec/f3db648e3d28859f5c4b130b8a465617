Durban - It’s here! The trailer of the sequel to the local smash hit, Keeping Up With The Kandasamys. The official trailer to the new movie,  Kandasamys: The Wedding was revealed on Friday. The film sees the likes of Jailoshini Naidoo, Maeshni Naicker, Mishqah Parthiephal and Madhushan Sing return in their respective roles. Director Jayan Moodley said Kandasamys: The Wedding was being filmed across Durban. Moodley said the movie is set for a bumper Easter release on April 19 next year. This time, Naidoo and Naicker are back at each other's throats trying to plan their children's wedding. As expected, both mothers have very different views of how this wedding is going to go down. But I won't spoil it for you, watch the trailer.   Keeping Up With The Kandasamys gained critical fame across the country. (Personally, my daughter has watched it several times and Aya and Arsevan are her favourite characters!) The original movie told the story of the matriarchal rivals of neighbouring families, whose young adult children become romantically involved. The mothers, played by Jailoshini Naidoo and Maeshni Naicker, exhaust all efforts to keep the couple apart often with hilarious results. Daily News
