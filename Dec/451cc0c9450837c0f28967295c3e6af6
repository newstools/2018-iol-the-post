Durban - INTERNATIONAL relations and Cooperation Minister, Lindiwe Sisulu is concerned about the number of South Africans detained in jails abroad. According to a statement by DIRCO, over 800 South Africans are in prisons around the world. According to the minister, around 21% of those are in South America on drug-related charges and over 98 South Africans were detained in China for visa-related violations during the past six months. At this stage 23 of them remain in detention in China while police investigations are continuing. Earlier this year, more than 100 young South Africans who travelled to teach English in China, where detained, cautioned or questioned regarding visa violations. Sisulu calls on those travelling to register with DIRCO or the South African Diplomatic missions abroad to ensure they have the right travelling document. “It is very disconcerting that many South Africans are being arrested or detained abroad. We call on South Africans to make sure that they have the right travelling documents and correct visas where applicable. "They should also know the location and contact details of the South African embassies, high commissions and consulates in the countries they are visiting.” She added that she has tasked the department's director general to ensure that those who were arrested, receive consular assistance. She also said she would engage her Chinese counterpart on the number of South Africans being arrested and detained in China. She urged travelling South Africans to know the Department’s 24-hour switchboard number 012 351 1000 in case they need any assistance. POST
