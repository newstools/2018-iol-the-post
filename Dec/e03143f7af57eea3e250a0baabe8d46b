In a press statement, it said following an intensive investigation (a commission of inquiry into sexual harassment at the public broadcaster), the commission made findings and submitted recommendation which the SABC was implementing. “The SABC confirms that an appropriate course of action has been initiated against all the alleged perpetrators in line with applicable company policies and relevant legislation. “The alleged perpetrators have been served with requisite notices to afford them an opportunity to make representations in response to the action initiated by the SABC.” According to a source, the notices could be for disciplinary hearings where those who had been accused during the inquiry would have a chance to present their side of the story. Allegations of misconduct, sex for jobs and editorial interference raised earlier in the year resulted in the broadcaster assigning two independent commissioners to look into sexual harassment in the workplace. The inquiry began on June 1 and completed its work on October 31. The independent commission released its findings early this month. The commission found that sexual harassment allegations made by former and current employees were either never addressed or not death with. The commission’s chairperson, Barbara Watson, revealed that the public broadcaster’s sexual harassment policies did not meet international standards and needed to be reviewed. She also found some victims had been forced to resign and some of the harassers were people in top positions. The Western Cape was the only region that had no cases of sexual harassment in the workplace; most complaints were from KZN. Watson said the commission had to move to KZN to hold hearings there, while all others were held at their offices in Johannesburg. POST
