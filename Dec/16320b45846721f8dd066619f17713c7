Durban - Police have opened an inquest docket after skeletal remains were found at a Bluff property on Tuesday. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said men were digging a trench at the property when they discovered a human skeleton. "The remains were found about one-and-a-half metres deep into the ground. Police officers from the SAPS Search and Rescue team were called in. It is estimated that the skeleton could be between 90 and 100 years old. An inquest was opened at the Brighton Beach police station for investigation," she said. According to a source, the property has been cordoned off. "We are waiting for teams from the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) in Pretoria to arrive. Specialists from the KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Resources Authority (AMAFA) have also been asked to attend to the scene. The bones are very old and are of archaeological interest. The remaining bones have been left in the ground where they were found. Once the teams arrive, they will investigate further," the source revealed. Daily News
