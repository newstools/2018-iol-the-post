Durban - Angry community members packed the public gallery of the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Wednesday morning, ahead of the court appearance of the Phoenix mother and her boyfriend who are charged with attempted murder following the brutal beating the woman's four-year-old daughter. The two minute video, which was allegedly recorded by the woman's boyfriend, went viral on social media in March. Minutes before the matter was heard in court, angry residents gathered outside holding up placards condemning abuse of children and appealing for justice for the little girl. The 25-year-old mother, dressed in a white t-shirt and jeans, was seated in a corner outside the court room surrounded by her family. Her eyes were filled with tears as she occasionally looked up. A few seats away from her was her 22-year-old boyfriend. Dressed in black he sat with his head down while his family sat around him. In the dock, the couple stood next to each other with their hands behind their backs. They did not make eye contact with each other throughout the court proceedings. As part of their bail conditions, Magistrate Chris Annamalai told the couple that they were not allowed to make contact with the child. The child who was discharged from hospital last week, is currently being cared for by her paternal aunt. According to attorney Kelvin Walker, she was doing well despite having difficulty walking. In the video, a woman is seen smacking, kicking and stomping on the child 46 times while shouting vulgarities at her. Following the release of the video, angry community members torched the man's car forcing him and his family to flee their home and close their business. The mother has also fled her home fearing for her safety. The matter has been adjourned to April. POST
