Durban - The historic 103-year-old Shri Luxmi Narayan Temple in Mobeni Heights is staying put. The temple’s premises and massive hall, a landmark of the suburb for decades, will not be sold, it was decided on Tuesday. Read: We're moving temple for its future good “It has been saved,” said Habi Singh, a member of the Concerned Persons Group formed to try to prevent the sale. The group had met SA Hindu Maha Sabha president Ashwin Trikamjee and temple officials. “The meeting was well attended. It was good to see both parties get together to seek a way forward,” said Trikamjee. “The concerned group will give three names and so will the temple, and those six will work together to sort out the temple.” Singh, who celebrated their victory with his group, said the temple was a symbol of struggle. “During apartheid when Indians were forced to move, so did the temple. And it stands tall in Mobeni Heights. It is seen as a symbol of not letting apartheid destroy it and now we managed to save it from any future relocation.” LC Maharaj, from the Shri Vishnu Temple in Chatsworth, said: “I am on top of the world! I am glad the Maha Sabha stepped in and handled this matter, bringing both parties together. "There will be challenges, but the important thing is both parties agreed to assist one another with them.” POST
