Durban - Having made his mark as an MC, Denver Naicker is on the road to success, after landing a presenter’s job on Glow TV’s new show I Do and being appointed the brand ambassador of Childline KZN. Naicker, who hails from Durban and owns The Master of Ceremonies, said he was thrilled to have the opportunity to assist, motivate and empower children through his journey. “I aim to create awareness and ensure that everyone understands the importance of protecting and promoting children’s rights,” Naicker said. “At the same time, I intend to motivate children through my own story that hard work and determination are the key to success.” He added: “I come from humble beginnings. Nothing was handed to me on a silver platter. “Despite it being a long and challenging road, I had to work hard for all that I’ve achieved.” Naicker, the public relations officer at Hirsch’s Homestore, turned to emceeing after he was retrenched from his IT job in 2015. “I was a good public speaker and after attending various weddings and social events, I decided to enter the MC industry. "At first I was nervous and did not feel I was good enough. “Added to that, a friend once commented that I was new to the industry and who would hire me? That was, for me, an indirect motivation and I wanted to turn a ‘no’ to a ‘yes’.” He started doing small gigs at weddings and birthday and anniversary parties as well as small scale social gatherings. “In 2016, I took a giant leap and opened my own company. It was challenging as I had to brand myself, but I never gave up.” He now runs a flourishing business. “It has been a tough but exciting journey. I have already worked at over 100 events and am working on new ventures.” A producer recently noticed his talent and he landed a plum role as the presenter of the wedding show I Do, which is screened on Sundays at 2pm. His dream is to present on SABC3. “You have to be hungry for success.” Naicker is currently studying customer relations management at Unisa. POST
