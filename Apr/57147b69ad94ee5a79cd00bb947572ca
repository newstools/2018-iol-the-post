Durban - Fancy having a Ferrari, Maserati or Rolls-Royce in your garage but worry about the hefty price tag? Well, you still can, if you’re lucky enough to bag a bargain at a unique supercar auction in Durban. International Bank Vaults boss Ashok Sewnarain, who also runs the popular IBV Supercar Club, has put together the inaugural IBV Supercars, Art and Shopping Festival to be held at the Gateway Theatre of Shopping from Wednesday to Sunday. About 80 cars will be there, some on private sale and others on display. “We will also be holding a bespoke auction for those interested in being an owner of one these extreme-designed and high-performance cars. "We have 40 supercars on auction, which include Lamborghinis, Ferraris, Aston Martins and Audis, to name a few,” he said. They range in value from R1million to R8m. Some of the supercars up for auction include a 2016 Bentley Continental GT, 2013 Porsche Carrera, 2016 Maserati, 2011 Ferrari 458 Italia, and some classics, such as the 1936 Ford Delux, 1971 Mustang Grande 460 and 1948 MG Roadster. Opening bids start at around R400 000. IBV was hoping to create a new platform for traders, buyers and sellers of supercars through the auction, said Sewnarain. Owning a supercar is the “ultimate achievement” for any car fanatic and fundi, he said. “It is a relationship between human and car that causes feelings of exhilaration.” The four-day festival will also showcase a variety of artwork and fashion. “We have given them (upcoming artists) the platform to come out and put their best work forward, whilst putting their hats down and getting some donations, or hand out their business cards to potential clients, but most importantly, we are happy that we able to provide them a place to showcase their talent.” Sewnarain said he hoped to make the festival an annual event in Durban as well in other provinces and countries.
