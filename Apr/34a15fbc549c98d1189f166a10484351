Durban - To significantly reduce the waiting time for cervical cancer treatment, The Department of Health will distribute 15 brand new cancer machines to hospitals around the province. Department of Health spokesman, Desmond Motha, said the machines, known as LLETZ machines, are used to prevent cancer of the cervix. “The function of the LLETZ machine is to conduct a small surgical procedure on the woman’s cervix by using electrical current. "The procedure removes that part of the cervix where the cells are becoming abnormal (dysplastic), which might otherwise develop into cancer. Motha said said the abnormal cells however could only be detected by pap smear, which must be done regularly. “An important feature of cancer of the cervix is that the disease has a long pre-cancer phase which lasts for several years. “This provides an opportunity to detect it (by pap smear) and then to treat it with the LLETZ procedure, before it progresses to cancer. "Unlike many cancers, cancer of the cervix is preventable.” The new machines, he said, will therefore increase the capacity to prevent cancer of the cervix in KZN, by allowing this procedure to be available in more sites.
