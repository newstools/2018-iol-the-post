Durban - Education academic, Dr Ansurie Pillay received the coveted Distinguished Teachers’ Award (DTA) from the University of KwaZulu-Natal for her displayed evidence of an educational impact beyond the classroom. The award recognises teachers who’ve had a favourable and lasting influence on students. “I see the award as an affirmation not just of me but also of many staff members who are working innovatively in, sometimes, difficult circumstances to make a difference to the students with whom they work. "Many of us strive to approach education through a commitment to change and social justice, in all its complexities, and this award affirms this objective,” said Dr Pillay, who received the award at her graduation ceremony on Tuesday. She completed her undergraduate degrees at the former University of Durban-Westville and her postgraduate degrees through the University of KwaZulu-Natal. During her years as a high school teacher, Pillay obtained a cum laude in teaching English as a second language from Cambridge University. She also worked in television production, winning a Commonwealth Vision Award in London for excellence in filmmaking. “My career as a teacher in urban high schools showed me the extent to which institutionalised discrimination shaped lives but also the role that teachers can play in enabling learners to rise above obstacles,” said Pillay. Her approach to education is informed by a commitment to change and social justice. “As an academic in the School of Education, I draw on who the students are, what has shaped their educational journeys, and how they understand education. "I also aim for agency in my students, so that no one is silenced and all voices are respected. This award reminds me to re-affirm this goal.” POST
