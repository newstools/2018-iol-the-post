Durban - He lit up the stage and left audiences in stitches, but Essop Khan is no more. The popular performer and playwright died at his Asherville home at the age of 72 on Monday following a long illness. “We have been friends for more than 50 years and knowing that he is gone is tough,” said Mohammed Ali, who had also worked with Khan. Khan’s contribution to the South African theatre, film and media industry included his role in a later version of Mothie in Ronnie Govender’s 1972 The Lahnee’s Pleasure. Ali said he went to see Khan, who owned EKMA Productions, on Sunday and held his hand as he was unable to speak. “He squeezed my hand slightly and made a slight noise, to tell me he knew I was there with him.” Khan never married but Ali said he was fortunate to have his family around him. “He told me if anything happened to him, he would have absolutely no regrets and told me to live my life the same way. But the truth is, when you lose someone so close to you, it’s heartbreaking.” Warrick Frank, owner of a drama academy and a presenter on East Coast Radio, said Khan had taken him under his wing. “Essop gave me more than just a chance to perform, he nurtured all novice actors and shared with us his wealth of knowledge and experience.” Tributes have poured in on social media including from many local actors, writers and directors.
