The 75-year-old grandmother was hit on the head with a spade, stabbed many times in the head and savagely beaten. She had been alone at her home in Trenance Park when the assault occurred in what is believed to have been a robbery last Thursday. Her domestic worker and her gardener boyfriend are suspected of having carried out the attack. They had worked for her for just under a month. Neighbours called security company Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) when they heard the woman scream for help. The two were allegedly seen fleeing from the property. Rusa boss Prem Balram said they found the woman bleeding profusely from the head and the home ransacked. “At around midday, members were dispatched to the residence after receiving a call from a neighbour requesting assistance. “The woman was treated at the scene for multiple stab wounds to the head and face. She also had a black eye from the assault. She was stabilised and taken to hospital. “This old woman could have been killed in this brutal attack. "The hired help in this case turned on her and brought reinforcements to gang up on her. They used gross violence and force. “It is imperative to thoroughly check the references of domestic and maintenance employees in this dangerous age. It is not safe to give free rein in your home to people you don’t know, especially if they have close contact with your family,” said Balram. “If potential workers cannot furnish references, rather look at other applicants who have traceable references. "The elderly and children are soft targets for marauders. Take the necessary precautions to keep your family safe,” he said. The victim’s traumatised family did not want to comment." POST
