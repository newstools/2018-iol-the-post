Durban - Three flats were completely destroyed at the Merebank shopping centre, in south Durban following a blaze on Thursday morning. According to Rescue Care spokesman, Garrith Jamieson, paramedics arrived on scene just after 10 am, and a total of five patients had sustained minor injuries. Jamieson said they were stabilised on scene. According to division commander, Nkulumo Dube from the Fire Department in Jacobs, who attended the scene, the fire was confined to 3 homes. "We suspect the fire started at one of the flats were the owner was not at home. Due to the intensity of the fire we can't determine the cause at this stage. “Two rescue pumpers and two specialised vehicles including an hydraulic platform for high rise buildings were brought to the scene.” According to a resident who lives in one of the flat, all she could think about was saving her 5 children. She grabbed formula and diapers as she ran out of the flat, escaping through the fire escape. POST
