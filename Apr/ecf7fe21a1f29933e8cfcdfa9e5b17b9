Durban - A 9-year-old boy who was shot during a robbery in February has returned to school - with the bullet still lodged in his stomach.
He was shot at his uncle’s home in La Mercy.

"He is happy to be back at school with his friends. For now, he is not able to play sport.” Robbers had entered the home on the pretence of being fumigators and ransacked the place. The boy’s aunt and his cousins hid in their bedroom and the family’s domestic worker heard their cries for help. She contacted the boy’s uncle, who alerted police. As the robbers fled the home, family members who lived next door tried to apprehend them but the gang opened fire, injuring the boy. His uncle said that they were grateful to everyone for their prayers and support during this difficult time. The boy has undergone counselling to help him deal with the trauma of the incident. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said there had been no arrests. POST
