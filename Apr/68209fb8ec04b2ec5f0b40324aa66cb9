Durban - A KwaDakuza (Stanger) pensioner’s regular trip to deliver cakes at a local bakery in Verulam took a tragic turn when his vehicle struck a cow on the R102 early on Saturday morning. Ramesh Boodram, 63, who was accompanied by his wife and an employee, died at the scene. The two passengers were injured. The bakery manager, who declined to be named, said he was horrified when he heard the news. “Ramesh was on his way to drop off an order of cakes, as he usually does. "He only started working for the bakery seven months ago after we had to replace our previous driver, who suffered a stroke. "He is a pensioner and took the job to supplement his income.” Boodram was described as being a religious man who enjoyed visiting the temple. “He was respected and well known in the community. He was a man without blemish, a humble man who loved people.” POST
