Durban - Graduating summa cum laude (with greatest honours) in industrial psychology at UKZN was a walk in the park for 21-year-old Mariam Adam, pictured. The Phoenix resident, who also received four certificates of merit for ranking in the top three in four modules in her class, said she always enjoyed industrial psychology and was initially aiming for cum laude. “A lot of people say this field is difficult, but I disagree. It all came naturally to me and I was pushing for a cum laude, so when I found out it was an even better pass, I was ecstatic,” she beamed. Not only was Adam excited, but so, too, were her family. “On my dad’s side I am the first grandchild to graduate in the family, so everyone called and congratulated me. "It’s kind of the same on my mom’s side, because I am the second to graduate. My cousin also graduated summa cum laude, and to follow in her footsteps is amazing.” She is now studying towards her Masters degree and hopes to then pursue her PhD and lecture industrial psychology. Adam, who lives in Phoenix with her dad, said her parents, though separated, supported her throughout her studies. POST
