Stocked with eight 15-inch Star Sound subwoofers, eight XS power batteries and a Targa 19KZ amp, 34-year-old Shiraz Kalil’s 1985 Volkswagen Golf Mk1 was a force to reckon with. Kalil was placed first in the bass-boxing and sound pressure level (SPL) category, and was the overall winner on the day. Bass-boxing pits competitors against each other to find the loudest sound system, while playing music tracks. “My car has one of the loudest car-audio systems in the province and is also one of two cars in the country that does bass-boxing,” he said. Kalil said he spent over R60000 on his sound system. He added that his passion for cars started as a child, while watching his panel beater dad at work. “I have always loved cars and it did not matter whether it was a classic or the latest model. As I grew older, the passion for cars and ‘banging’ sound never died.” Kalil said he decided to enter car shows in 2002. He said he first entered the sound-off competition at the T3 motor show last year and placed second overall. 
“This year I claimed my title." POST
