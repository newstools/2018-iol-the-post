Durban - A triple tragedy has rocked the town of Dundee in KwaZulu-Natal with the recovery of the bodies of a couple and their friend. On Tuesday, two days after police divers found the body of Molly Juggan, 55, in the back seat of a SAPS van that had washed away in a river during a flash flood, the bodies of her husband, SAPS Warrant Officer Jakes Juggan, 56, and family friend Ashoak Rajoo, 52, were found washed up on a riverbank a few metres away from the vehicle. When the couple failed to return home on March 23 their son Ramil reported them missing. According to a source the couple and Rajoo were believed to have been travelling on a low-level bridge when the van washed away into the Sand River near the Landmansdrift Bridge in Malonjeni. Police and community members worked tirelessly over the past 11 days in a bid to find the trio. Last Sunday, officers who were out searching the area where the last cellphone signal of the coupleâ€™s phones had been picked up, spotted the roof of the police van sticking out of the water. Divers from the police search and rescue units in Durban and Pietermaritzburg were called in. Upon searching the vehicle, the decomposed body of a female was found. POST
