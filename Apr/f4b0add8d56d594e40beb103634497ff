Durban - A total of R76 000 in cash and donated items was collected during the Celebrities Unite campaign over the weekend. As part of the #PAVCARES CSI initiative this month, The Pavilion pulled together local celebrities to raise money for the Edith Benson Home that was ravaged in a fire recently. Some of the celebrities who participated in the initiative was local actress and model Kajal Bagwandeen as well as Keeping up With the Kandasamys stars Mishqah Partiephal and Madhushan Singh. Hollywood’s Bets Dolphins, The Cell C Sharks, Candice Abrahams, DJ Tira and many more allowed patrons an exclusive opportunity to rub shoulders with the who’s who in the entertainment industry. Distruction Boyz also made an appearance with patrons donating money to receive an autographed t-shirt or cap from all celebrities present. The proceeds have since been donated to the Edith Benson Home who are in the process of rebuilding their home. Marketing Manager of The Pavilion, Julie - Anne Zuma, said that her team at large knew they had to mobilise to give back to a community right on their doorstep. "But what was even more encouraging, was the true coming together of a diverse spectrum of shoppers for the greater good. “We are happy that we could, with the assistance of our celebrities, support where help is truly needed.” POST
