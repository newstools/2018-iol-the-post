Durban - Four young women who have aspired to wear the coveted Miss SA crown are one step closer to realising their dream after they qualified for the regional round of the competition at Sibaya Casino. Karishma Ramdev, Avania Reddy, Leah Prinsloo and Noxolo Ndebele made the cut at the weekend - with further selections around the country scheduled to take place until April. The Top 12 will be announced on May 3 and the winner will be crowned on May 27 at the pageant’s diamond jubilee at Time Square Sun Arena in Pretoria. The winner will receive more than R2 million in prizes. Ramdev, 23, of Chatsworth, said: “I grew up with two dreams - to be a medical doctor and to be Miss SA. Being selected for the regionals means I am a step closer to achieving my dream.” The fifth-year medical student at the University of Pretoria said she was nervous about entering. “But the judges loved me. They noticed me interacting with others and being genuinely interested in those around me, which made me more confident, and proud of myself for taking the leap and entering.” She remembers the moment she realised she wanted to be a Miss SA. “It was 2000 and my mom was looking at YOU Magazine and said ‘look at our new Miss SA, Jo-Ann Strauss’, and I thought she was the most beautiful girl. “I remember saying I wanted to be a Miss SA one day.” Fellow regional finalist, 25-year-old Reddy of Westville, said making the finals would put her in good stead to help others. “I would love to get involved in charity work, help underprivileged families and make an impact in people’s lives.” The mechanical engineering student said being selected was a stamp of approval.
