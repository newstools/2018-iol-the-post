Durban - Having the strong belief that readers are future leaders, the principal and teachers at Silverglen Primary School in Chatsworth ensure the little ones read every day. The school offers a reading corner in classrooms filled with books, magazines and newspapers, as well as a reading period, reading programme and participation in reading events such as the “World Read Aloud Day”. School librarian and Grade R teacher Sarah Govender said reading formed the basis of learning, and it should not be limited. “There are so many positive benefits that arise from reading. When children read regularly, they are exposed to more vocabulary, which then aids them in writing. “They are also exposed to more ideas, allowing them a greater imagination, which improves their creative writing skills. There are many pupils who still struggle to read at intermediate levels, so it is vital they are constantly encouraged.” Govender said the school was excited after POST donated about 200 books for Mandela Day last year. “We were happy when we were selected to receive the large book donation as we were able to expand our collection and achieve more reading goals,” she said. The school offers a reading session every morning between 7.30am and 8am. “The children, together with their teachers, read together and some would be asked to read aloud. We also have a reading programme where each class is allocated time to spend in the media centre.” She added: “There is so much that can and needs to be done to promote reading.” POST
