Durban - A Chatsworth mother has vowed to do everything in her power to get justice for her daughter,allegedly murdered by her husband in November. Mining company employee Shane Wentzel, 34, walked out of the Middleburg High Court on Thursday after the case was struck off the roll. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) allegedly failed to instruct the State prosecutor on the way forward with the case. Wentzel was accused of killing former Chatsworth hairdresser Nisha Ravikumarie Wentzel, 34, at their Mpumalanga home. Police initially ruled her death a suicide, but investigations by a private Pietermaritzburg-based forensic company and post-mortem results suggested foul play. Nisha’s mother, Rose Henry, said: “I cannot believe the justice system let me down. I will do everything in my power to get justice for her. As a mother, I am desperate to find closure. “My daughter suffered horrible injuries to her head, neck and body. He cannot get away with this terrible crime.” Henry said she had always known that her daughter would not take her life. “She had fought cancer and was a brave person.” Wentzel’s family said their legal team had advised them not to comment. The NPA did not comment at the time of publication. POST
