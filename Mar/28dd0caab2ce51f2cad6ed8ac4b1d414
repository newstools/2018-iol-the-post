Durban - Thousands of people from all walks of life are expected to visit the Habibia Soofie Darbar on Alpine Road over the Easter weekend to celebrate its annual Urs Mubarak and Milad-un-Nabi marking 112 years. The event is an observance on the death anniversary of a wali (Friend of Allah) and to honour the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him). In Islam, through spiritual strife, sacrifice and the blessing and guidance of one’s peer or murshid (spiritual guide), one can attain the title of a wali. The four-day event is aimed at educating the youth on the life of a wali, enriching spirituality and performing zikr (remembrance of Allah). There will be na’ats (recitals) in praise of the Holy Prophet, and Qur’an recitation. Urs Mubarak has been observed in South Africa since Hazrath Soofie Saheb arrived in Durban in 1895 to propagate Islam. Soofie Saheb’s five sons, as they came of age, had the responsibility of following in his footsteps. He built 12 mosques which catered for the needs of the community and whoever went to his door, never left empty-handed. His youngest son, Hazrath Shah Muhammad Habeeb Soofie Habibi also known as Jhande Peer, developed and maintained the Alpine Road mosque. Among the events, former Durban resident, Hazrath Moulana Moorthoza Kassim, who teaches Islamic studies in London, will render na’ats on Thursday after Esha and on the days to follow. Friday’s programme will start from 11am going into Jumu’ah Namaz. The Sundal Shariff will take place on Saturday after Maghrib at 6pm. Local Qawwalis, Khalid Nawaz and Ridwaan Kaloo, will perform Mehfil-e-Sama (Qawalli) on Saturday after Esha. The Sunday programme is dedicated to the Cause of the Creation, Muhammad Mustapha (peace be upon him). Ladies’ accommodation will be provided and meals will be served. POST
