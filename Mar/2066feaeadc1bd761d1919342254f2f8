This is what an Inanda commercial sugar cane and chicken farmer said following a land grab at his premises. Living with his wife and children at the farm, the farmer was reluctant to speak to the media saying the matter is at a sensitive stage. “It is still continuing. There are men with guns who come and patrol the land every day to make sure we don’t interfere with their land grabs.” Visiting his farm last week, POST witnessed several clearings on his sugar cane fields with plantations uprooted and discarded. The farmer said some of his crops, ready for the mill, were just dug out without any regard or permission. The farmer added that in 1994 his father’s first cousin died in an accident and he was left with the option of buying the property. He said he had the title deeds to prove it. The farmer produced documents that showed “permission to occupy”. “My core business is sugar, but I also have a chicken farm, which goes back to 1972. We used to sell 6 000 chickens per month. "But with all the imports that came in, that business fell through. After acquiring more land, sugar became our core business.” Speaking about the intimation, he said it was difficult to speak to locals without feeling uncomfortable. “They tell us this is their land and we must leave and stop all our operations. We cannot stop our operations. We need to farm, it’s our job.” The farmer spoke on serving supporting affidavits in the Tea Estate Farming Organisation’s application to indict the indunas to stop selling their land to people. He said in June last year, Inkosi Mqoqi Ngcobo allegedly arrived with a police officer and told him his land was tribal land and they could do as they please. Lorraine Claasen, a criminologist at AfriForum, said 
365 farmers had been attacked in South Africa by the end of 2017 with 74 of them murdered. The figure stood at 339 attacks and 64 murders at the end of 2016. POST
