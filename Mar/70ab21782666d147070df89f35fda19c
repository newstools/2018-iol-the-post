Letter - My child attends a public school. I attended a public school as well. However, when I attended the school that I did under apartheid, the pupils and educators were all of the same race group. There are pupils and educators of different race groups at the school and there is blatant racism. The white teachers display a preferential attitude to the white pupils with respect to all codes of sport - even the codes of sport that the school mainly supports are reflective of the racism. White pupils are selected for school sporting events although pupils of colour, like my child, are faster and stronger. White pupils dominate in codes of sport like cricket, while the players of colour sit on the bench for the duration of the match, for every match. The A-teams in certain codes of sport consist mainly of white pupils. The principal, who is also white, has refused to be engaged regarding our concerns. I struggle, although I am an educated professional, to explain to my child that he is not equal to other pupils because he is not white. I struggle to explain to him that he is lower down on the sports selectors' lists because his skin colour is brown. I wonder if I was not protected from the emotional trauma that my child is experiencing by the old regime. It is incredible that some things have not changed in this country despite the years of reconciliation that we know of, which also makes me wonder: is racism a genetically inherited trait? I ask this question as some of the educators are in their 20s and 30s, yet display racist behaviour. My husband fears our child will be victimised by these educators if we escalate our complaints - isnâ€™t it just awful that in South Africa in 2018 we fear to speak out against racism? POST
