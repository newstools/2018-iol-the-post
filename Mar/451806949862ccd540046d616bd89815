Durban - When a Welbedacht, Durban, family lost their wood-and-iron home and meagre possessions in a fire earlier this month, they felt helpless and alone. But the community and several businesses gave them a surprise that has brightened up their lives. They’re fast on their way to rebuilding their home and this time it’s a two-bedroomed brick house.

Three weeks later and our home is almost complete. All we need is roofing material and we can move in.” Her husband, Denzil, also 31, who works as a security officer, and their sons Dentre, 9, and Melden, 15, were equally excited. POST reported shortly after the fire that the family had been left with only the clothes they were wearing and a prized photograph of their late daughter, Denlissa Tyralina, who died of myocarditis - inflammation of the heart muscle - a week after turning 1 in 2011. The family moved into a single room in Naidoo’s mother’s adjoining home, which was partially burnt in the fire. “When this happened, we did not know how we were going to build a new home, but through God’s grace we have a brick house. “Kind members from the community and businesses stepped in and offered building material, including bricks, stone and cement. "We also received a donation of bricks from the Golden Gateway School which Melden (who has Down syndrome) attends. My uncle, who is a builder, graciously offered to build our house. Everything is finally coming together.” POST
