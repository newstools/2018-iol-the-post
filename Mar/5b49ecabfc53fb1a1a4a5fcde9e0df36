Durban - Two men accused of killing a young Bluff mother were expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court again on Wednesday for a formal bail application. Darryl Murrisson, 33, and Christopher Houston, 26, are accused of shooting mother of one, Bianca Parsons. The 33-year-old was seated in her car with her 3-year-old daughter at a petrol station on Tara Road, Wentworth, on Saturday evening last week when a gunman fired shots at her. Her husband was in the service station shop at the time. Parsons died at the scene but her child was unharmed. The two men were arrested last Monday. A firearm suspected to have been used in the killing was recovered. “One of the accused was found at his place of residence with a pistol in his possession, and two magazines with eight rounds of ammunition. “The firearm has been sent for ballistic testing to ascertain if it was used in the murder,” said police spokesperson, Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane. KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major-General Bheki Langa, commended the officers for the swift arrest. “Immediate police investigation, which led to the arrest of the suspected murderers and the recovery of the firearm, is commended. “We will ensure that we gather enough evidence and send a well-prepared docket to court for a successful prosecution,” said Langa. Meanwhile, a Facebook group, #JusticeForBianca, has been set up, demanding action from the authorities. POST
