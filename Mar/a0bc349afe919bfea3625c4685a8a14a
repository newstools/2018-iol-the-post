Durban - A joint awareness campaign by eThekwini Transport Authority, Metro Police, RTI and SANRAL officials to educate taxi drivers and passengers about road safety at various taxi ranks around the City kick-started today. In a press statement the City said that road safety was one of their top priorities as high volumes of visitors were expected during the Easter weekend. The week-long road safety campaign is expected to cover most taxi and bus ranks, especially the long-distance public transport ranks in eThekwini. The campaign will conclude by an awareness raising motorcade led by Mayor Zandile Gumede, which will run through the city centre on Thursday, 29 March, encouraging the community to prioritise road safety. The motorcade will be focused on long distance taxi ranks and it starts at YMCA taxi rank at 10am on Thursday and will finish at the Williams Taxi rank opposite the DUT City Campus. The City urges road users to always observe road traffic rules, fasten their seatbelts, not drive under the influence of alcohol, ensure that vehicles are roadworthy and exercise patience on the road. The following tips can help reduce fatalities on the roads: •	Keep your eyes on the road at all times. •	Never use your cell phone. •	Ensure that your vehicle is in a roadworthy condition before departure. •	Never, ever drink and drive. •	Follow speed limits. •	Always wear your seat belt. •	Take safety breaks every 2 hours or 200km.
