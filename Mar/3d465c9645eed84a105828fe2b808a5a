Durban - The baby girl who was delivered at home by her parents, in March last year, celebrated her first birthday this month. And baby Alovah who weighed 2,95 kilograms at birth will ring in her day with 14 children at uShaka Kid's World this weekend. According to mum Navlene Pandaram, 33, Alovah loves climbing on furniture, dancing to music and her favourite cartoon character is Shimmer and Shine. It is also the theme for her party. Last year Pandaram, a real estate agent, and father Sumen, 35, a technician, managed to deliver their baby at their Malvern home, without the help of any medical professionals and told POST it felt like the most natural thing in the world. “We just did what our instinct told us to do and God has his hand over us,”  Navlene told POST at the time. Recalling the hours up to their youngest daughter’s birth, Navlene recalled stepping out of the shower and telling her husband that there was no time to go to the hospital and that the baby was coming. She delivered the baby on her bedroom floor with the help of Sumen, who cleared the baby's airways before the paramedics arrived. “The paramedics could not believe I had given birth. I still had make-up on,” said Navlene who was thereafter taken to hospital. “It was the most natural thing in the world, and I had no pain or any medical procedures.” The couple said they planned on not having any more kids and were happy with their three kids, Natalia, 7, and Josiah, 2.
