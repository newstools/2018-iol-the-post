Durban - As a build-up to his 65th birthday, businessman and philanthropist Vivian Reddy partnered with Reach For A Dream to make the dreams of 65 children with life-threatening illnesses come true. “I turned 65 last month and decided that before I celebrate my birthday, I wanted to do something for the children at the organisation. "Every Friday since last March, I spent two hours making children’s dreams come true,” said Reddy. On one occasion, he met a young girl who wanted to experience what it was like to be a model. “Together with a team, I arranged for a runway to be set up at the Gateway Theatre of Shopping and provided her with clothing. "There was also a captivated audience to watch her model. She was so excited, more so because she could keep the clothing,” said Reddy. A young boy dreamt of riding in a BMW 7 series. “We arranged it and gave him a model of the car and gifts. His mother said she had never seen him happier.” For Reddy, it’s the strong will of the children that touches his heart. “Although they are faced with life-threatening illnesses, these children have such a positive outlook on life and are extremely strong-willed. "They taught me a few lessons. Some of us, when we get sick, it’s like the end of the world, but these children remain so positive.” As a birthday gift to Reddy, the foundation presented him with a coffee-table book with well-wishes from all 65 children. Reddy encouraged readers to do their part for the foundation: “Give a donation or become a volunteer. It is going to a worthy cause.” POST
