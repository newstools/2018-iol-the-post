Durban - For the past 11 days a Gauteng family has been searching desperately to find their elderly mother who has gone missing while on holiday in India. Retired dressmaker Devikiamma Devi Pillay, 76, formerly from Isipingo, was last seen on February 24 boarding a train from Mumbai to Bhubaneswari (Orissa) at Lokmanya Tilak Terminus in Kurla. Her son Kenny this week left for India to head a search party for his mother, while family and friends circulated a missing persons notice on social media. The grandmother of four, who has been travelling since November, was supposed to visit her friends but when she failed to arrive they notified her family in South Africa. A relative, who requested anonymity, said that before going to India, Pillay had travelled to Norway, Sweden and Denmark. “Her brother is a doctor in Norway and she had visited him and other relatives. "She checked in with her family on a regular basis so we knew she was doing well. Just last month her children Mala and Kenny joined her on holiday in Mumbai. “She has a clean bill of health and with medication her high blood pressure is under control. This was her ninth trip to India. “For this trip alone she has been on 12 flights without any issues. We have contacted the South African Embassy and the High Commissioner’s office in India for assistance. "We have been told that for a search party to be conducted a family member needs to be present.” The relative said they had also sought assistance from the Indian High Commissioner’s office in South Africa and the Department of International Relations and Cooperation. “We are hoping that with Kenny bein g in India we will get some answers. In the meantime we are remaining positive and appealing to people to spread the word about her disappearance”. POST
