Durban - The KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial police Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, has welcomed the life sentence handed to a convicted rapist this week. “Violent men are not allowed to stay in our society, we will make sure that all those involved in crimes against women and children are sent to prison indefinitely,” said Langa. This week, 26-year-old Nqobile Zondi, was jailed for life for raping an 11 year old female in the Imbali Township, while Siphiwe Hlophe, 26, was jailed for 12 years for raping a 21 year old scholar. Both incidents took place in 2016. KZN police spokesman, Lieutenant colonel Thulani Zwane, said Zondi had raped an 11-year-old girl at her home. “In September 2016, the 11-year-old victim was at her residence at Imbali township, assisting at her mother’s shop when the accused asked to buy cigarette. "The victim went to her mother’s room to fetch the cigarette, the accused followed her in the passage and grabbed her to the room and raped her." Zwane said a case of rape was opened at Plessislaer SAPS and Zondi was arrested shortly thereafter. In addition to his life sentence, Zondi was also jailed for an additional 10 years for housebreaking in the Pietermaritzburg Regional Court. The Camperdown Regional Court heard that Hlophe, had accosted his 21 year old victim while she was on her way to school to write her matric exam. "He dragged her to the bushes near the Umsunduzi River and raped her at knifepoint and fled," said Zwane. A case of rape was opened at Umsunduzi police station and it was transferred to the Pinetown Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for investigation. After Hlophe's arrest, police found that he may be linked to another rape matter from 2015, through DNA. "The investigation into that case is ongoing and Hlophe is still awaiting trial," said Zwane.
