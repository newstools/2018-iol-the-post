Sport - South Africa’s Musfiquh Kalam is among 16 table tennis players who will participate in the International Table Tennis Federation’s Africa Top 16 Cup in Kenya from tomorrow until Saturday. The 15-year-old from Cape Town will compete against the continent’s best at Nairobi’s Kasarani Gymnasium. As Southern African region champion and reigning Western Province junior Player of the Year, Musfiquh goes into the tournament in east Africa with optimism. In the host nation team the South African teenager will meet veteran Indian-origin player Sejal Thakkar who has been selected by Kenya to play her fourth Commonwealth Games in Australia in April. “It’s the passion of the game that drives me and brings me back to the TT table time and time again. Playing against the top 16, some of whom we interacted with prior to Khartoum 2016 Olympic qualifiers, will be all good and a moment to savour for long,” 42-year-old Thakkar said. Meanwhile in tennis, the Gauteng East Seniors squad is looking for players to represent the province at the Boland 50-60+ Age Group Interprovincial Tournament from April 15-21. Players in the 65+ age group who are willing to play are also encouraged to contact Gauteng East Seniors Tennis.
