Durban - The Verulam man accused of raping his stepdaughter more than 900 times has been denied bail. The bail hearing which began on Monday was finalised on Friday in the Verulam Family Court. The 43-year-old will be an awaiting trial prisoner at Westville Prison. Crowds gathered outside the court cheered and celebrated on hearing the news. Chief magistrate Irfaan Khalil refused bail on the basis that the accused was found to be a threat to society and to the child. He also found him to be a flight risk. “In assessing interferance, we consider previous violence and threats made to have a reasonable probability of interference.” He also found the majority of the State’s evidence unchallenged. He also dismissed the defense’s case of exceptional evidence. “I am not satisfied that there is exceptional evidence to show that he should receive bail. Circumstances which have a very common place cannot be deemed exceptional.” The accused was arrested last month. He is alleged to have held his stepdaughter captive in their home, using her as a sex slave. The child remains in a place of safety. The case has been adjourned to August for further investigation.
