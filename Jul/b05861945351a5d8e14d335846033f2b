Durban - National police spokesman Brigadier Vish Naidoo, has quashed allegations of a possible bomb threat at the Pavilion shopping centre on Monday. Naidoo said they had received a call about a suspicious parcel that was found. "In any such call, the standard operating procedure is to cordon off the area and make the area safe again." "It was a false alarm, whoever made the call actually found a security tag." This is the fourth incident in which reports of a bomb-like device has been found. On Thursday police were called to the Woolworths store in Gateway and Pavilion, and the devices found were taken by the Explosive Unit for further investigation, KZN police said. There was another incident at the Woolworths in Gateway on Saturday. Speaking about the investigations into these incidents, Brigadier Naidoo said they were investigating who were primarily responsible for placing these devices and establishing the motive behind it.
