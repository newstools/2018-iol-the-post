It seems that nepotism and favouritism was, is and will always be the underlining theme at the station. The Indian community has only one national public broadcaster that caters solely for their listening pleasure but sadly it is the most embarrassing. The management is up to no good. There are far too many jocks on air, all trying to outdo each other, and talking over one another at times. Thank goodness for the internet; I am afforded the opportunity to listen to stations around the world and, sad to point out, Lotus FM is immature and amateur at the same time. DJs or RJs, as they are called now, are so often singing their own praises and sharing stories about their personal lives. One DJ so often talks about her shows and her travels abroad. Whenever she comes back from a holiday, the entire programme is all about the holiday and her sidekicks are all yes people. Then there are some who only feature their friends on air. Lotus FM is an embarrassment to the Indian community. It has no class whatsoever. There is no decorum between management and staff. There is no need for change because there are other options for radio. However, listeners who are hooked on to the station - it is what it is.  POST
