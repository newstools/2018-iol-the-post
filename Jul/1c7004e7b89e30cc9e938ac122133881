Durban - Residents living near the uMhlangane River have been asked not to use water from the river until further notice. This is due to the failure of the four pumping units at the KwaMashu Wastewater Treatment Works. According to the city's acting head of communications, Mandla Nsele, water from the facility is discharged into the uMhlangane River, which flows through the Avoca area, north of Durban. "The affected pumping units are currently put offline to commission necessary repairs, resulting in only a single pump being available to pump the incoming flow to the works. The remaining unit is unable to handle the flow to the plant and untreated raw sewage is being discharged to the river," Nsele said. He said residents are prohibited from using the river water below the treatment works for consumption or any recreational activities during this period. "The affected areas will be demarcated with relevant signage. The municipality will undertake all necessary action to rehabilitate the river once the treatment works reaches full compliance," he said. Nsele explained that some flow is being diverted to the old treatment works to reduce the volume of untreated effluent going to river. "The effluent is currently screened, degritted and disinfected to reduce environmental and public health impacts on the river. The river will be aerated to increase oxygen levels and assist aquatic life. It will also be monitored and sampled daily with samples being sent to the laboratory for testing," he said. Daily News
