Kaunda said while the constitution guarantees the right to protest, this right must be exercised peacefully and is regulated by the Gatherings Act. He said any demonstration not complying with this Act is unlawful and would be "manageed" appropriately and in accordance with the law. Declaring war in these illegal protests said Kaunda anyone implicated in illegal protests would face the full night of the law. "The anarchy must come to an end," he said. The Mercury
