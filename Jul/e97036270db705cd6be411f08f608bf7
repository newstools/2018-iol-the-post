Durban - A portion of the proceeds raised from this weekend’s Neha Kakkar concert in Durban will be used to furnish two children’s homes in Phoenix. The promoters who spearheaded the Durban show, Events4U, with the assistance of corporate sponsors, announced the donation of R500 000 on Saturday at the Sun Park at Sibaya. Last year, owner Dave Dipooa handed over R100000 to the Phoenix Child and Family Welfare Society after a concert featuring songstress Vidya Vox. Dipooa said: “This project is aimed at assisting children who are victims of callous crimes and are often neglected and abandoned. The safe house will be the first in Phoenix and beneficial for the community.” The society’s Sharm Maharaj said the donation would be put to good use. “The two children’s homes will be completed at the end of the month and this contribution will help us acquire 14 beds, drawers, curtains and cupboards. "The funds will basically help us furnish these homes. We are blessed and thankful to E4U for always supporting and standing by the community.” Prior to the concert, 30-year-old Kakkar said she had fallen in love with South Africa: “It’s my first time here and I am loving it. On Friday I was in Johannesburg, today I’m in Durban and my shows are packed. "For any artist to have a packed show is amazing, because it shows we are doing something right. For a small girl like me to be loved so much, it’s an honour.” POST
