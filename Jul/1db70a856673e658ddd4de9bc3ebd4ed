Durban - A 32-year-old man was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment after he was found guilty of raping an elderly woman in Bulwer, in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, earlier this year. In May, Dish Zamokuhle Memela gained entry into the home of a 72-year-old woman. Police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said the woman woke up after she had heard strange noises inside her house. “She found Memela in her house and hid. When he saw her hiding behind a door, he dragged her out from where she was and raped her. He then fell asleep and the woman managed to grab and axe and hit Memela on the chest. He got up and ran away from the house. He left behind his clothing and cell phone,” Gwala said. A charge was laid at the Bulwer police station and later transferred to the Plessislaer Family Violence, Child Protection and family Violence Unit for further investigation. Gwala said Memela was arrested and charged. “He was sentenced in the Ixopo Regional Court this week after several prior court appearances,” Gwala said. Daily News
