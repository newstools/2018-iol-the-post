Durban - Nine people have been arrested following the truck blockade on the N3 on Wednesday morning. Police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, confirmed that the nine were arrested for public violence in Pietermaritzburg. "They will appear in court soon, once charged," she said. Their arrests come after a series of road blockages across the city. From around 4am, social media was abuzz with reports of traffic being delayed along the N3, Higginson Highway, at the 45th Cutting offramp in Sherwood and other areas. The protest is to stand up to the high fuel prices currently facing SA motorists.  The #FuelPricesMustFall campaign said they wanted to raise awareness of the impact escalating fuel increases were having on ordinary people and hoped the government would listen to them. Paul Jenkins, #FuelPricesMustFall co-ordinator, said South Africa supplies fuel to surrounding countries. He questioned why residents paid higher fuel prices. How should our people survive in this country? The government needs to downgrade the fuel price immediately to at least R8 per litre. Nobody can work and survive at these costs. Food, transport, daily living expenses are way out and our people are suffering.  We stand by our rainbow nation. Say no to fuel levies and increases," he said. Jenkins' campaign is a separate campaign to that of Durban activist Visvin Reddy who has convened the People Against Petrol and Paraffin Price Increase (Pappi) campaign. Daily News
