Durban - DA leader, Mmusi Maimane got a congregation in Chatsworth on its feet when he took on racists during a church service on Sunday. His message resounded with the 1 600 strong congregation of the Christian Revival Church (CRC) following EFF leader, Julius Malema’s recent comments that the majority of Indians are racist Maimane was invited to address the congregation by Dr Paul Lutchman, senior minister and founder of CRC. Maimane took to the podium and spoke on a range of issues including crime, corruption, drug addiction and unemployment. In his address he touched on the topic of racism, saying it should “offend everyone”. “When you look at someone and make them sub-human, you have moved away from what God has pulled us through,” he said. Dr Paul Lutchman, senior minister and founder of CRC added that Malema’s comments in itself were racist because he sees “colour”. “Julius Malema is a racist because he sees colour and we don’t. I am an African, I was born in Africa and we are all one people.” Read: Malema racist for picking on Indians - Yacoob Lutchman gifted Maimane with a leather-bound King James Version Bible and laid hands on him, praying for wisdom, knowledge and understanding and for God to help him use his voice to help the people of the country. Lutchman later warned the congregation that many politicians would want to use the church’s platform to preach politics but asked the congregation to be steadfast in their faith and never comprise in what they believe. “We must not be afraid. This is our place of worship. Our place to glorify, magnify and lift up the name of Jesus. We pray God will open their eyes, minds and hearts,” he said. POST
