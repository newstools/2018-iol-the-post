Durban - Scenes of jubilation greeted delegates filing in to the ANC conference in Durban on Thursday evening. Earlier during the day, six ANC members from the Lower South Coast and Moses Mabhida regions, approached the Pietermaritzburg High Court seeking an urgent interdict.        The presiding judge wanted to know why the members made their application at the last minute, to which they responded that they only found about the conference via an article in The Mercury. They added that they were not given enough notice time. Despite the attempt, the urgent interdict was struck off the roll.            The conference is expected is being hosted at the Durban University of Technology's Steve Biko Campus. ANC secretary general Ace Magashule is expected to deliver the official opening address. An elated Nocawe Mafu, an ANC NEC member deployed in KwaZulu-Natal, reacted to the news that a court application seeking to stop the provincial conference had been struck off the roll. "It is all systems go. We are about to start with the eighth provincial conference of KwaZulu-Natal. Can you beat that?" she said. Delegates chanted "Aaaaaaaace" as the ANC secretary general, Ace Magashule, arrived at the hall.      The Mercury
