Durban - The ever-popular Bachelor series is coming to SA. Well, we thought the singles in our midst would be happy but it seems many would rather walk on a bed of thorns that stand in line for the coveted red rose. (See what we did there?) We ran a poll on our Twitter page and were tickled pink at the response. While 24% of The Mercury followers would be interested in taking part in auditions this weekend, a whopping 41% find the whole idea ghastly. Funny enough, 16% of those who took part in the poll were neither here nor there and would perhaps consider it, 19% were not even fazed that auditions were taking place right here in Durban!  Wait, did you not know auditions were taking place in Durban? Right, we got you. M-Net is holding auditions across the country. If you’re single, over 21, ready for romance, and meet the requirements stipulated in the Terms and Conditions (published on the website) then make your way down to RocoMamas Gateway to audition. The auditions will be taking place on Friday, July 27 from 1pm-6pm and Saturday, July 28 from 11am-4pm. You will be auditioning in front of the delectable Tevin Naidu. All you need to do is complete the entry form at the venue and move on to a 90-second speed date with a local, stand-in bachelor. This will be used as your official video entry. If you cannot make it to the auditions for The Bachelor SA, you can enter online at www.mnet.tv/thebachelorsa. Entries close on August 20, 2018, at 23:59 pm. The Bachelor SA will kick off on Valentine’s day, Thursday, February 14. (Not cheesy at all, ok!)
