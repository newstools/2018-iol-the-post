Durban - A Phoenix man has appeared in court after metro police claimed they found drugs worth more than R200000 in his possession during a sting operation in Chatsworth. Bryan Radhakishun, 41, was arrested late on Thursday outside a food store in Umhlatuzana. Radhakishun was allegedly caught with 11150 “sugars”, whoonga and heroin capsules with a street value of R223000. He appeared in the Chatsworth Magistrate’s Court on Friday morning and has applied for bail. A formal bail hearing is expected to be held this week. Metro police spokesperson Parboo Sewpersad told POST the efforts by officers who carried out the arrest had not gone unnoticed. “Our members worked tirelessly to conduct their sting operation. Eventually an arrest was made in the late part of the night. We have to commend these officers for their hard work and dedication. "It has emerged that the accused was allegedly a runner from Phoenix who has been operating here in Chatsworth. It’s worrying because this drug scourge is affecting all vulnerable communities and now it is coming from one community to another. "This arrest is a step in the right direction and hopefully we will soon bring the actual merchants to book.” Sam Pillay of the Anti Drug Forum said the organisation welcomed the arrest. “The metro unit that made the arrest is a special unit that was disbanded a few years back and started up again recently. Since coming back these guys have been effective in making drug-related arrests and convictions. It is amazing how a small unit can be so effective and we need more specialised units like this.” Pillay said there was also a need for a specialised court “that has qualified and credible personnel to ensure more convictions are made, because at the moment conviction rates are very low, and higher conviction rates are the key to cutting down supply and eventually ridding our communities of drugs”.
