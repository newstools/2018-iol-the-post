Durban -  Four people have been arrested for public violence after they allegedly blockaded the N2 near Umgababa with tyres and stones complaining about an increase in taxi fare. KZN police spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, described the situation as "tense." He said Public Order Police (POP) were currently at Umgababa where a group of about 300 people blockaded the N2 near Umgababa with tyres and stones. "Protest action has been taking place since 5:30am this morning and affected traffic severely. The POP members are still at the scene to monitor the situation." Nandhan Arran, from EMS 24 hrs KZN, are keeping the public updated on the latest developments in the area. A South Coast woman who was travelling to Durban for work, said she was absolutely terrified because there was no way to turn around and go back home. She said that protestors were throwing stuff from the top of the bridge and it delayed her trip by about 20 minutes. "I am a little nervous about going home this afternoon, but I hope it will be clear." DAILY NEWS
