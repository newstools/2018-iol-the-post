Durban - Newly-elected ANC KZN chairperson Sihle Zikalala says that former president Jacob Zuma's detractors who thought his support in KwaZulu-Natal had dwindled, and that he would be deserted by everyone, are mistaken. Zikalala said that they supported Zuma in 2005 and again in 2006 until the late High Court Judge Herbert Msimang struck the case of the roll and that they will continue backing him. "We will be back here again on the 30th November. We want a fair trial without undermining the law," Zikalala said. He said they were not defying the ANC as they were supporting Zuma in their own capacity and that the case had dragged on for 17 years because the judiciary had nothing tangible to pin on Zuma. BLF leader Andile Mngxitama, who was also there to support Zuma, said: "Inside court we saw that it was Msholozi vs White Monopoly Capital but because Zuma is a man of the people it is 1 to the poor and 0 to White Monopoly Capital. "There's no case here, Zuma is being vilified. This government must stop harassing president Zuma and his family," Mngxitama said.     MKMVA spokesperson Carl Niehaus said Nelson Mandela was a principled man who understood justice and the Constitution and that would he have supported Jacob Zuma. Niehaus added that some alliance leaders such as Blade Nzimande, who had supported Zuma over a decade ago, were now hypocritical. "Let us be consistent in our pursuit of justice, let us not be fair weather friends," Niehaus. Nkosenhle Shezi, secretary of Nafupa SA, said they stand with Zuma because he recognised the disparities and inequalities that exist in the economy. "We're standing with any black person who is being prosecuted, we're standing with the Ingonyama Trust and Duduzane Zuma." Political Bureau
