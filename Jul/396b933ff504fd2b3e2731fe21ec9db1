Durban - People Against Petrol and Paraffin Price Increases (PAPPPI) has called off their protest, which was scheduled to take place on Friday. Convener, Visvin Reddy, said they decided to call off the planned shutdown as they are meeting with officials from the president's office. "We have been in discussions with his office and they have agreed to meet with us, in Johannesburg. Our committee is of the view that we will be acting in bad faith if we continue with our protest action scheduled for tomorrow (Friday). We have stated before that protest action is the last resort. As responsible leaders, we will explore all options available," he said. In a video on his Facebook page, Reddy said PAPPPI's main aim is to bring down fuel prices in the country.   Last week, Reddy distanced PAPPPI from an anti-petrol increase protest that left major routes in and out of the province blocked. Ten people were arrested for public violence. They were released after they appeared in the Pietermaritzburg High Court. At the time of the blockade, Reddy, issued a statement saying they will not be held responsible for any damage to property nor injury to anyone due to irresponsible people who do not adhere to the aim of the cause.
