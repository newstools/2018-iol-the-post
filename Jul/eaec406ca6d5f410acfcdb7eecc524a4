Durban - Police are investigating whether a family dispute led to the murder of a Kharwastan, Chatsworth man and the wounding of two others. Itheqar Ahmed, 50, was shot dead and two of his relatives were wounded last week. The two are still in hospital. Their families have declined to comment, saying the matter was “sensitive”. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said it was alleged that the men had gone to visit Ahmed at his Heron Street home. “A dispute broke out and, during the altercation, three people were shot, resulting in the death of the man. "Two injured people were taken to a local hospital, where one remains in a critical condition. Police seized two firearms that were allegedly used in the crime.” Residents who heard the gunfire said they hid. “Everything was quiet and calm. I was standing in my yard with my children and suddenly we heard three shots being fired and then screams,” said one resident, who asked to remain anonymous. “I was not sure what was going on. I grabbed my children and ran into our home.” She said the family had moved into the house only recently and no one really knew them. “This is the first time something like this has happened in our area. Generally it is quiet.” Another resident, who lives two houses away, said she thought something had exploded. “I heard screams, but did not leave my home to see what was going on. I was also afraid and concerned about my safety.” No arrests have been made. POST
