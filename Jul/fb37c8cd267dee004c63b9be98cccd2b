Durban - A man was killed and two others left critically injured following an apparent gun battle in Briardene, Durban, at the weekend. It is believed that the men were walking along the railway lines that run parallel to Chris Hani (North Coast) Road on Sunday evening when tragedy struck. Marshall Security's Kyle van Reenen said, the three were found lying on the railway tracks. "All three men had sustained multiple gunshot wounds. Two of the men were found to be in a critical condition. Advanced life support intervention was needed to stabilise them, whilst paramedics from Crisis Medical and Netcare911 worked fervently to keep them alive," van Reenen said. He said once stabilised, emergency teams prepared an intricate rope system, which was used to lower the patients down the steep embankment to ambulance vehicles parked at the side of the road. "Unfortunately there was nothing paramedics could do to assist the third man who had sustained multiple fatal gunshot wounds and he was declared deceased on the scene," van Reenen said. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, KZN Police spokesperson, said three people were allegedly shot by unknown suspects. "A 25-year-old man was fatally shot. Two others sustained injuries and were taken to hospital for medical attention. The motive for the attack is unknown.   Charges of murder and attempted murder were opened at Greenwood Park police station for investigation," Mbhele said Daily News
