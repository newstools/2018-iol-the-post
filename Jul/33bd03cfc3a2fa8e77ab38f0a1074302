Durban - The stench of rotting garbage, faeces, urine and a decaying dog carcass continue to fill the air in the plush suburb of Shannon Drive in Reservoir Hills.Resident Ron Naidoo made headlines last week when her 14-minute voice recording of deputy mayor Fawzia Peer telling her to complain to her councillor, not her, went viral on social media. The eThekwini Municipality was yet to resolve the problem, she told POST on Tuesday. “There are about 300 people living in the informal settlement within the suburb who do not have proper places to dispose of their dirt and garbage and are doing so on our road. “The toilets that were erected for them are not working, resulting in them urinating and passing faeces in packets and buckets,” said Naidoo. She claimed these were being dumped on the roadside. “This is not a political issue but a community issue. I have not received any feedback from the mayor’s office,” Naidoo said, referring to her initial complaint that led to Peer calling her. “I contacted DSW (Durban Solid Waste) on Friday, and an official came out to assess the place, but nothing more happened.” Naidoo said some residents were unable to breathe properly. “It is getting from bad to worse, and it does not seem like we are going to get any assistance.” Another resident said she could no longer live with the smell and dirt. “Something needs to be done to clean up the area. Fix the toilets for those living in the settlement, and provide a place for them to dispose of their dirt.” A resident from the settlement said what they needed was proper housing. “We cannot live like this, too. There are a few toilets for 300 people. That is not right. People are using buckets to relieve themselves.” The municipality had not responded by time of publication. POST
