Durban -  Fans of the East Coast Radio afternoon drive show can rest easy. Bongani Mtolo will not, we repeat, not be leaving the radio station. Last week fans were sent into a tizz after the station announced that Mtolo had resigned. On Tuesday afternoon, station management issued a statement saying Mtolo had decided to retract his resignation and has, subsequently, signed a two year contract with the station. “After much consideration regarding my resignation from East Coast Radio and weighing up the other opportunities available to me, I decided that it was not the right time for me to leave the station.”  He added that he had worked extremely hard to be appointed as the drive presenter and that the show is on an upward trajectory and he still has a lot he wants to achieve at the station," Mtolo said. ECR programming manager, Zane Derbyshire, said, he was thrilled that Mtolo had decided to stay. "He is a talent, someone who is loved by our listeners, great to work with and most importantly puts our brand first," he said. Mtolo began heading the Drive Show team in July last year, replacing controversial radio jock Phat Joe. The Richmond-born, Maritzburg College 'old boy' started his radio career at ECR in 2015 ultimately to work his way up to hosting the show with co-presenter Mags, and scooping the win for the Best Afternoon Drive Show presenter Liberty Radio Awards.
