Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit detectives were tipped off to a 14-year-old girl having nude images of chidlren on her phone. When her phone was seized and; “it was discovered that she was taking nude pictures of two young females aged nine and 10, sending them to her boyfriend.” Mbhele said upon further investigation, it was revealed that the man was having sexual relations with the girl. When his home was searched, hard drives containing child pornography were found and he was arrested. This week, he was sentenced at the Newcastle Regional Court 10 years imprisonment for having sex with a minor, 10 years for sexual grooming and 10 years for possession of images of child pornography. Five years on each sentence was suspended for five years, said Mbhele.
