Durban - A 31 year old man was jailed to life imprisonment on Friday for the rape of his 14 year old stepdaughter. The court heard that the victim had been living with her stepfather mother and during the period of December 2015, sharing a one-roomed house at Matshana area, Empangeni. According to KZN police spokesman, Captain Nqobile Gwala, when the mother of the victim was working night shift, the victim used to stay behind with the accused and that is when he would rape and give her money to keep quiet. "The victim became pregnant and the matter was reported to the Empangeni police station for further investigation. "Through hard work by the Empangeni Family Violence, Child and Sexual Offences Unit, the accused was arrested and charged accordingly," said Gwala. Last month, a 29-year-old man was sentenced to two life sentences by the Johannesburg High Court on Tuesday for raping and murdering a 14-month-old baby girl. The man kidnapped the child and its mother, then raped and killed the baby in September 2015 in Tembisa. Read: Two life sentences for man who raped, killed 14-month-old baby POST
