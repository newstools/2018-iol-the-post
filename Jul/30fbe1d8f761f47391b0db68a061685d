Durban - A Farmers' Day hosted by UKZN and uMngeni Resilience Project (URP) aims to bring together various experts that will address issues faced by small scale farmers. The event will take place at UKZN’s Ukulinga Research Farm in Pietermaritzburg on July 11. About 150 participants are expected to attend and discuss experiences, challenges and aspirations of small-scale farmers from across the uMgungundlovu District and beyond. The Farmers’ Day will enable international and local researchers to hear first-hand from small-scale farmers about the challenges they face and what their needs are, allowing researchers to work together on developing effective strategies to ensure that their research has real-world impact. This will aid researchers in achieving their research goals of improving resilience to growing threats to agricultural production that include extreme weather events, crop pests and diseases, drought, fire and more. The Farmers’ Day will coincide with a workshop being hosted at the University that week on the topic of “Breeding and modelling underutilised crops for community resilience”. This workshop is funded by the British Council’s Researcher Links initiative through the Newton Fund and South Africa’s National Research Foundation (NRF), and will bring together early career researcher from South Africa, Kenya, the United Kingdom and Malaysia. The workshop will include discussions around enhancing agricultural and plant breeding research to improve communities’ resilience to the challenges they face. Daily News
