Durban - Police are appealing to residents, who may have information about a murder in Verulam, to come forward and assist in the investigation. This appeal comes after a 24-year-old man was found slumped over his seat, with a single gunshot wound, to the head earlier this week. The deceased has been identified as Ashil Premchun. According to KZN police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, on July 17 the man's body was found inside his vehicle at Cornerstone, Verulam. "His cellphone and wallet was missing. We are appealing to anyone who might have information about the suspects to contact the local police or our Crime Stop on 08600 10111," she said. Gwala said that a case of murder has since been opened. Reaction Unit Director, Prem Balram, his officers had responded to the scene on Tuesday. "Reaction Officers traced the registration of the vehicle in an attempt to identify the deceased and found his home in Unit 17 Phoenix," he said. Balram said Premchun's younger brother contacted them about the shooting. "He told us that Premchun had left home earlier that day with R10 000 cash in his possession to purchase a bull bar from Verulam for his bakkie," he said. This is a second blow for the Premchun family, as their father was killed in a hit-and-run recently. Daily News
