Durban - Police in KwaZulu-Natal are appealing for information that could assist in an investigation, after 11 people were killed in suspected taxi-related violence at the weekend. The eleven people were associates of the Ivory-Park Taxi Association in Gauteng. National police commissioner, General Khehla Sitole, has condemned the act. On Saturday night, 17 people travelling in a taxi on the R74 between Colenso and Weenen, came under fire. They were returning from a funeral in KZN and were on their way back to Johannesburg. National police spokesperson, Brigadier Vish Naidoo, said four people were critically wounded and were recuperating in hospital. He added that two people escaped unharmed. "In response to these heinous crimes, General Khehla Sitole has activated a 72-hour action plan which consists of members from specialised units within the police including crime intelligence, The Directorate for Priority Crimes Investigation (Hawks), detectives and the special task force, to trace and apprehend those responsible for these killings," Naidoo said. He added that police did not want to speculate on the motive for the attack. KZN acting provincial commissioner, Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi and his management team are overseeing the investigation into these murders. Anyone who might have information that will assist police to arrest these senseless killings is encouraged to contact their nearest police station or phone the SAPS Crime Hot-Line on 08600 10111.
