Durban - The newly-elected chairperson of the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal says those who lost out in the provincial conference will not be booted out of their government positions. Delivering the closing address at the conference, Sihle Zikalala, said no one will be removed from their deployment based on the views they had prior to the conference. Premier Willies Mchunu is one of the leaders who lost having unsuccessfully contested the position of deputy chairperson which was won by Mike Mabuyakhulu. Zikalala emphasised the importance of unity in the party saying the ANC should now turn its focus to securing a victory in the 2019 general elections. Zikalala implored delegates to go to all the corners of the province and win the hearts of voters to ensure a "decisive victory".      He also slammed arrogant public office bearers.      "The ANC cannot afford to keep councillors and members of parliament and legislature who look down on people and those who are not of any service at all," he said.      The Mercury
