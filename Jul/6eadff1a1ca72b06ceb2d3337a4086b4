Pietermaritzburg - The case against former President Jacob Zuma has been postponed until November 30 after both the State and defence asked for an adjournment. Zuma faces corruption, money laundering and racketeering charges that were originally served on him about a decade ago. Zuma's new legal team, headed by advocate Michael Hellens, plans to bring an application for permanent stay and have since abandoned thoughts of reviewing the charges. Deputy judge president Isaac Madondo remanded the case until November 30. He, however, told Hellens and Advocate Anton Katz, representing co-accused Thint, they have until November 16 to make their applications. The matter will be heard at the end of November at the Pietermaritzburg High Court.     State advocate Billy Downer said they also intend on amending the indictment to add a “sub-charge” against Thint. Hellens argued that the State did not have its house in order despite saying they are ready to proceed with the criminal trial. Hellens also assured the court that his team was “here to stay” and there were no finding issues for them. Political Bureau
