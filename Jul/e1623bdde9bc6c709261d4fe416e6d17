Bonga Gcikwa: To have visible armed guards at malls is more dangerous than having unarmed guards reason being it's most likely that they may be disarmed and there will be possible shoot out in a crowded space and possible fatality to civilians and officers, the best is to install monitoring devices like surveillance cameras monitored 24/7 and guys equipped with panic buttons for the area armed response. Deploying an armed guard is the option best if the site has been assessed in terms of fencing and access monitoring is of good standard. DAILY NEWS
