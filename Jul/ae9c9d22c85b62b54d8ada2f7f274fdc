Letter - “To err is human, to forgive is divine.” With reference to Alochna Moodley using the k-word aboard a flight (“A lesson to other youth”, July 11-15), should the Reverend Mabuza be Christ like and forgive her, whether she is a Christian or not? When Julius Malema used a derogatory word against an entire township of Indians in Lenasia, he feigned ignorance and was forgiven, and had charges dropped by angry Indians. Now his EFF spokesperson is demanding punishment for Moodley, the opposite of a pardon to what his boss got. This proves the unfairness and hypocrisy of the EFF and its members (predominantly African). Moodley did impugn the dignity of three of my African brothers (and fellow South Africans) on the plane and we Indians consider her conduct totally unacceptable. Like Malema she too feigned ignorance.

The Indian community, her family and teachers cannot be held accountable for her derogatory comments. She has already lost her job and whatever dignity she had. Does she not deserve some mercy, like Malema, and forgiveness by the good reverend and his fellow companions? I read a story about her meeting with the reverend and a local Christian priest. We trust this was not in vain and all parties can make and find peace. If Jesus forgave his murderers and persecutors on the cross, how far and how long do we want to carry our cross (anger and unforgiveness)? As a Christian, my plea is to lead by example as Jesus Christ did. Blessed are the peacemakers for they will inherit because God gave it to all of us. POST
