Durban - The city has rubbished rumours that they are funding a music concert set to take place at the Moses Mabhida later this year. According to social media reports, the city has committed themselves to paying R56 million for Cassper Nyovest’s #FillUpMosesMabhida taking place in December at the iconic venue. Head of marketing and communications at Durban Tourism, Sbu Zondi, said the rumours were fabricated.      “The city dismisses this fabricated news circulating on social media platforms and regards them as malicious. It should be noted that the city continues to engage with various event organisers to identify leveraging opportunities to market the destination through hosting key events,” Zondi said. He said events are part of the city’s visitor strategy to market the destination by identifying leveraging opportunities to promote the destination. Zondi said there have been talks with the organisers of the event, however, no agreement on funding support has been concluded. This will be the fourth Fill Up concert by Nyovest, following up on the successes of Fill Up The Dome, Fill Up Orlando and Fill Up FNB Stadium.  Nyovest announced in June that he was planning a #FillUpMosesMabhida concert.      Daily News
