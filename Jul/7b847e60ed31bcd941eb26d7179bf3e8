Durban - Social activist Yusuf Abramjee will be one of the men participating in the 100 Men March set to take place on July 10. The aim of the march is to get 100 men from different sectors of society, including business organisations, civil society groupings and government “to a visible front of men marching together to show their commitment to making South Africa safer for women and children". Abramjee who is an anti crime advocate said "the time has come for us to raise our voices and take a stand against violence for women and children." "Enough is enough. We have to do something to raise awareness and education. The levels of violence are unacceptable high. Men have to take a stand," said Abramjee. He added that he approached by government to support this march and he agreed. "We all need to do this and become active citizens." The march will take place on from Church Square, Pretoria at 10am and make its way to the southern lawns of the Union Buildings. Other stakeholders expected to join the march include government Departments, NGOs, media houses, business,taxi associations and other stakeholders to show a united resolve to fight and raise awareness against the scourge of violence against women and children. According to GCIS “the scourge of violence against women and children is a huge threat to our development as a nation. This initiative is inspired by this year State of the Nation Address by President Cyril Ramaphosa's "Thuma mina' speech. During the campaign men and young men are encouraged to rally behind the campaign with slogans such as "Not in my name" will women and children be abused. The march coincides with the centenary celebrations for former president Nelson Mandela and struggle activists Mama Albertina Sisulu. POST
