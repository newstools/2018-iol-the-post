Durban - Golden girls Sria Velloo and Diyara Prakash are flying high after bagging gold medals at the World Championship of Performing Arts in Hollywood. The teenagers, from Roodepoort in Johannesburg and Queensburgh in Durban, respectively, represented South Africa at the international event in Los Angeles and were among the best performers from 63 countries. Musician Sria won three gold medals in three genres of music - contemporary, jazz and original - and two bronze accolades for playing instruments. “I received the bronze medal first, so I told myself it’s fine because I knew getting gold meant you had to score over 90,” she told POST. “Then my name got called for the gold. I was shaking with excitement because I got three golds, not just one.” Sria, a pupil at the Curro Academy Wilgeheuwel, also qualified to participate at the semi-finals of the world championships at the Long Beach Centre for Performing Arts where she competed against performers in all age groups. Her mom, Kanya, said: “Sria played brilliantly. It was between her and a boy from China but he was exceptional and she was knocked out. We are still so proud of her.” Diyara, who celebrated her 17th birthday last Wednesday, won gold in the ethnic folkloric category and was the overall winner in the 16-24 division. She received a partial scholarship for a teen workshop at the New York Film Academy. “I am beyond excited. When they called out my surname, I looked up at the screen and saw my picture. I ran up to get my award,” said Diyara, a presenter on the KZN community radio station, Hindvani. The actress, dancer, and model said she enjoyed the experience abroad, especially making new friends, but admitted she could not wait to return home to her family. While Diyara returned last week, Sria and her family return this week after holidaying in Orlando, Florida. POST
