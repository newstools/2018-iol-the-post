Durban - The man accused of murdering a 7-year-old girl is due back in court next week for his bail application. On Tuesday morning, a large crowd of angry residents made their way to the Verulam Magistrates Court where the man was due to appear. Due to the large crowd and security fears, the matter was moved to the family court.  The man stands accused of raping and murderingÂ Sthembile Mila who died on Saturday at Shayamoya, near Verulam. While proceedings got underway inside, outside residents demanded that the accused be declined bail.  In reading out the charges, state prosecutor, San Barthu, said that on Saturday, the accused allegedly took Sthembile inside his room. He then allegedly stabbed her in the chest and dumped her naked body on a footpath, where she was discovered. Barthu said a post mortem was still to be conducted and more charges could be added later in. While the charge was being read out relatives of Mila began to cry uncontrollably which resulted in social workers having to escort them out of the courtroom. Daily News
