Durban - While former President Jacob Zuma sat inside the Pietermaritzburg High Court, hundreds gathered in the streets to show support for the man they believe is the "Champion of RET".       Armed with placards, a large crowd gathered, some from the night vigil held the night before, to pledge their support for Zuma.Â  One supporter in particulare, called on zuma to come back and lead the country in 2019.                Zuma faces charges of corruption, fraud , racketeering and money laundering. In court on Friday, Zuma's defence team and the State asked for an adjournment. Zuma's new legal team, headed by advocate Michael Hellens, plans to bring an application for permanent stay and have since abandoned thoughts of reviewing the charges. Deputy judge president Isaac Madondo remanded the case until November 30. He, however, told Hellens and Advocate Anton Katz, representing co-accused Thint, they have until November 16 to make their applications. Daily News
