Durban - Durban mayor, Zandile Gumede, has called on city officials to attend to the ongoing issues affecting refuse collection, which has caused major disruptions in and around the city. Addressing the city’s executive committee at a council meeting on Tuesday, Gumede said: “We need to ensure that this disruption comes to and end. Officials must deal with the issue." She was speaking after protesting subcontractors who are responsible for refuse removals in townships went on a rampage this week spilling refuse on main roads such as the N2. They were demanding that the city pay them two months worth of payments which they say are due to them. In Umlazi alone there are 89 sub-contractors working there and this was seen as part of the city’s strategy to increase economic participation for black owned companies. “While we speak of participation, as politicians we are not the news who must deal with the how part we are not expected to deal with implementation issues,” she said. Earlier this week, reports emerged that the Delangokubona Business Forum accused the city's councillors of meddling in the refuse collection tender, which lead to chaos as refuse removal was disrupted. uMlazi, KwaMakhutha, Umbumbulu, Isipingo, Folweni and Cato Manor were the most affected areas as sub-contractors once again went on rampage, forcing Cleansing and Solid Waste (DSW) trucks to offload rubbish onto the roads, including on the N2 near uMlazi and Amazimtoti.
