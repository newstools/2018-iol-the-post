Durban - Chairperson of the African National Congress Youth League's Coastal College branch, Bongani Usher Mkhize, was shot dead in uMlazi on Saturday morning. This was confirmed by the league's provincial secretary, Thanduxolo Sabelo. The motive of the killing was unknown but the league is not ruling out the possibility that it could be politically motivated. Sabelo described Mkhize as a very dedicated and promising young leader. "There seems to be a concerted effort to eliminate young people who are leading the Youth League," Sabelo said.      Mkhize led the league's biggest branch in KZN and was also the deputy chairperson of the ANC in Ward 88. While Mkhize was not a delegate to the ANC provincial conference - currently underway at the Durban University of Technology -  Sabelo said he had played a role in influencing delegates. The conference is going ahead and is expected to be concluded by Saturday afternoon after the election of additional members of the provincial executive committee. The top five leadership was announced on Saturday. Sihle Zikalala was elected unopposed as chairperson. His new deputy is Mike Mabuyakhulu who beat Willies Mchunu. Meanwhile Mdumiseni Ntuli beat Super Zuma to become the new provincial secretary while Sipho Hlomuka was elected the deputy secretary. Nomusa Dube-Ncube was elected unopposed as the provincial treasurer. The Mercury
