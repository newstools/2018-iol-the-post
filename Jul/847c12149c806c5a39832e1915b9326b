Durban - The ANC’s KwaZulu-Natal conference, due to start at the Durban University of Technology on Thursday, now hangs in the balance as some members of the party approached the Pietermaritzburg High Court seeking that the gathering be interdicted from going ahead. A highly placed source in the ANC confirmed the news saying the case was to be heard at 2pm. ANC provincial coordinator Sihle Zikalala confirmed to The Mercury that the ANC was aware of the plan to interdict it. “We have heard about it and we are attending to it,” Zikalala said. The Mercury understands that the applicants are from the Moses Mabhida region. Scores of delegates arrived in Durban earlier in the day to register for the party’s conference. This will be the second time this year that the party is attempting to hold the elective conference. The last conference had to be aborted last month after a group of disgruntled members took the party to court complaining that due processes had not been followed. Subsequently the leadership of the ANC held talks with the disgruntled members and an out of court settlement was reached. Sihle Zikalalala, the coordinator of the interim leadership structure, the provincial task team is expected to be re-elected as chairperson. The big contest is expected to be between Super Zuma and Mdumiseni who are both vying for the position of provincial secretary. The Mercury
