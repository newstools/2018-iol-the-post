Durban - President Cyril Ramaphosa has apologised to the community of Chatsworth for not showing up at a planned meeting on Friday night at the Nelson Mandela Youth Centre in Chatsworth. "The community of Chatsworth I am sorry that I could not come yesterday. It was due to unforeseen circumstances and a number of other meetings that were urgent; and the flight coordination was also difficult, but I promise that I will be coming," said Ramaphosa in a video that has been circulating on social media. The Chatsworth meeting, an ANC event under the theme, #ThumaMina (Send Me), was announced at the beginning of last week. The event was set to start at 6pm, and by 5.30pm the hall was full, with many people donning ANC regalia and singing. However, by 7pm the president still did not arrive. In his video the president assured residents that he would definitely attend the next meeting.   "I want you to arrange a special meeting which I will come to and I will spend quality time with all of you. So that we can discuss a number of issues. "My apologies for not being there yesterday (Friday night) and I will also table my apology when I come to see you again. "But thank you very much for your understanding and I will be there." The meeting has been rescheduled for July 13. Daily News
