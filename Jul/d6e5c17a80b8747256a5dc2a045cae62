Bollywood - Priyanka Chopra is working on a memoir, titled Unfinished, which will be published simultaneously in India, the US and Britain next year. Priyanka said she was ready to write about her feelings during the course of what had been a fascinating journey. “The flavour of the book will be honest, funny, spirited, bold and rebellious, just like me,” said Priyanka, whose foray into the entertainment industry began at the age of 17 when she won Miss India and went on to win Miss World. “I have always been a private person. I’ve never spoken about my feelings during my journey but I am ready to do so now. “I was raised to be fearless when it came to opinions, and I would like to tell my story in the hopes of inspiring people - especially women - to change the conversation, to shatter glass ceilings. “Women are always told we can’t have everything. I want everything and I believe anyone else can have it too. I’m proof of it,” she added. The surprise announcement was made recently by publisher Penguin Random House India, which also announced the publication of AR Rahman’s authorised biography. UK and Commonwealth (including India) rights were acquired at auction. Meru Gokhale, editor-in-chief, Penguin Random House India, said: “I met Priyanka Chopra for the first time when she delivered the Penguin Annual Lecture in New Delhi in 2017 and was amazed at the way people, especially young women, responded to her words.” POST
