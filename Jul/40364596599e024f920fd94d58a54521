Durban -  Video evidence of #FeesMustFall leader, Bonginkosi Khanyile, throwing stones at police officers during a protest was shown in court on Wednesday. Khanyisile's trial is currently underway in the Durban Regional Court. Khanyile did not show any emotion as the video was playing. The video, taken back in 2016, shows him throwing stones at officers and then later on using a slingshot against police. This was despite repeated requests by police for the protesting students to stop pelting them with stones. The video was taken by Warrant Officer Shaun Robins, who was giving evidence during examination by State prosecutor, Roshiela Benimadho. After the requests to stop the violence, police then decided to use stun grenades to disperse the gathering which had more than 100 students at the time at the Durban University of Technology's  ML Sultan campus. Khanyile, faces 13 charges which include public violence, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm and obstructing traffic among others. Robins said students used "fist size" building rubble to throw at them. This is the second day of the trial for the DUT graduate who is out on bail after it was obtained at the constitutional court last year after spending five months in jail, making him the #FeesMustFall leader who had spent the most amount of  time in jail.
