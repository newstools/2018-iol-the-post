Durban - The details of who fired the fatal shot that killed 9-year-old Sadia Suhkraj during a botched hijacking in May will only be revealed during the trial. According to well placed source who requested anonymity as they are not allowed to speak to the media, the ballistic report which has been completed will only be made available at the trial of Sibonelo Mkhize who was the only alleged hijacker arrested after the incident. His accomplice died at the scene and another is on the run. The trial is only expected to start next year. Mkhize made a brief court appearance in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. "While the ballistics reports are ready, nothing will be revealed until the trial begins," the source said. Sadia was killed in a botched hijacking on May 28. She was on her way to school with her father Shailendra when they were accosted in the driveway of a relatives home in Shallcross. The men made off with the family's car with Sadia inside it. An off-duty policeman together with Sadia's father tried to stop the vehicle by shooting at it. The source said that the delay in starting the trial is that DNA and aerial photos were still outstanding. Daily News
