Durban - People Against Petrol and Paraffin Price Increases (PAPPPI) has distanced themselves from the recent #FuelPricesMustFall debacle which saw 10 people being arrested and charged for public violence earlier this week. PAPPPI convenor, Visvin Reddy, issued a statement saying they will not be held responsible for any damage to property nor injury to anyone due to irresponsible people who do not adhere to the aim of the cause. Earlier this week, #FuelPriceMustFall protesters blocked the N3 and other major routes in and out of Durban, in a bid to highlight the pressure put on motorists since the recent petrol price increase. During the blockade, a woman and nine truck drivers were arrested and charged for public violence. The charges have since been dropped against the accused after they appeared in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Thursday. According to Reddy,  individuals and groupings are sowing division and confusion among supporters by calling for protests and road closures. “This is being done in a disorganised and haphazard manner. This is seriously counter productive and works right into the hands of the authorities,” he said. He added that if any member is arrested during one of PAPPPI’s protests, they will be defended in court at the expense of the movement. “If need be, we will pay their bail,” he said. Reddy said they have approached members of the taxi industry and national unions for their support in PAPPPI’s upcoming national shutdown on July 27. Daily News
