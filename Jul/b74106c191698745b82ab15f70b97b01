Durban - Reservoir Hills resident, Ron Naidoo, whose telephone call recording with city deputy mayor, Fawzia Peer, caused a stir on social media, said she has no regrets about her call. Earlier this week, Naidoo shared the telephone recording in which she rants about social delivery issues in her ward. Naidoo said she was frustrated with the ongoing issue of dirt not being collected in Shannon Drive. She then sent an email to city mayor, Zandile Gumede citing her frustrations and the lack of help from government. On Monday, Peer contacted Naidoo. In the telephone recording, Peer tells Naidoo that she (Naidoo) is a rude woman and that service delivery was not her (Peer's) problem. Peer then told her to speak to the ward councillor. "Since the article was published, I have received a telephone call from the Democratic Alliance apologising on Peer's behalf and assuring me that the ward councillor will be given the necessary back up to catch up with the backlog of service delivery in Reservoir Hills," she said. The DA's Thabani Mthethwa called the incident totally wrong. "It should be discouraged in the strongest terms. We serve residents. We cannot be rude to residents," he said. Mthethwa added that he has since written to the eThekwini council speaker to look into the matter and take the necessary action.
