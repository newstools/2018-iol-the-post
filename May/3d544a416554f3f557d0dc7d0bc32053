Durban -  Three suspects are expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Wednesday, on charges of public violence pertaining to the incident at Moses Mabhida Stadium, on April 21. The three suspects - a truck driver, 35, a taxi owner, 35, and a taxi rank manager, 29 - were arrested by members of the SAPS KZN Provincial Task Team. The Acting Provincial Commissioner commended the Task Team for the latest breakthrough. “We know how much of work has been put in by these dedicated detectives to bring us to where we are now in terms of the investigation. "It is only a matter of time before others are arrested. I would advise those who were part of the mob that went on a rampage on that unfortunate day to hand themselves over to police, as one of these three who were arrested did. "If not you will have to be continuously looking over your shoulders. We will not tolerate such hooliganism in this province,” he reiterated. Detectives are still appealing to those people that were injured in the violence to come forward and provide investigators with a statement. "Many of those that were injured left after receiving medical attention and did not leave their contact details behind with police," said police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker. Witnesses are urged to contact Captain Reddy on 082 458 5630 or Detective Warrant Officer Mlungwana on 082 662 7764. "All information will be treated with the strictest confidence," said Naicker POST
