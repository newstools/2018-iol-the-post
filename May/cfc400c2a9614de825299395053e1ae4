Chetty, an associate professor in physics and the acting college dean at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, was recently honoured with the Distinguished Teachers Award (DTA) by the university. The DTA is the highest award a lecturer can receive and it requires lectures to not only be outstanding teachers, demonstrating successful and effective learning outcomes, but to have made a sustained contribution to teaching. “For me my job is not about accolades. There is no greater thing than teaching, and this DTA is a rare, once-in-a-lifetime achievement, so when I found out I had been nominated I didn’t think I would be getting it because there are so many dedicated individuals. "I believe the students are number one, and this award is nothing without them,” he said.
