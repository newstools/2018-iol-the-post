Durban - One of the hijackers arrested on Monday, in the incident that claimed the life of 9 year old Sadia Sukhraj appeared in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. Sibonelo Mkhize, 32, faces charges of murder, theft and kidnapping. Mkhize was supposed to appear in the Chatsworth Magistrate's Court, but the matter was moved to the Durban Magistrate's Court instead amid security concerns. Dressed in a green jacket, claimed in court through legal aid, that he was beaten by police officers at Durban Central SAPS. Judge Mohamed Motala ordered that he spend the night at Westville Prison. The matter has been rolled over until Thursday. On Monday morning, Sadia was traveling with her father Shailendra, and 7-month-old brother to her grandparents' home opposite Marklands Secondary School when three men approached the vehicle she was sitting in and hijacked it.
