Durban - Having the love, support and motivation of his parents spurred Jashlyn Mothilall to persevere with his studies. He graduated cum laude and received a top supply chain student award at the Management College Of Southern Africa’s (MANCOSA) graduation ceremony. Mothilall dedicated his achievements to his parents. “It is not easy to find the motivation to push on and do your studies independently but at the time I was living with my parents, Vadesh and Sadhana, and they encouraged me a lot.” The Howick West resident, a supply chain manager at Nature Zone, said receiving the special award meant his hard work had paid off. After he matriculated, Mothilall studied toward a bachelors degree in accounting, “but I messed up”. “Through my studies I have learnt more about the supply chain field and on how it affects suppliers and customers.” POST
