Naren Singh, 38, an area manager for a local security company, said he arrived at the scene to find hundreds of outraged residents demanding justice for Sadia Sukhraj’s death. He said he was about to leave when police began using rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the crowd. “I was at the intersection when I heard loud bangs. People were running around and crawling on the ground. I saw a little boy on the floor and stopped to help him up. That was when I was struck in my left eye.” Singh said he was not sure if it was a rubber bullet or shrapnel from the stun grenade but the force of the shooting cracked his glasses and left bruising under his eye. Singh slammed police for treating protesters “like common criminals”. “Yes, the crowd was getting angry and uncontrollable because they were frustrated at the turn of events. But the SAPS should have handled themselves in a proper manner as there were elderly people, along with women and children. “Using tear gas was bad, especially for the older folk who suffer from wheezing, and their airways can collapse.” He said he left the scene quickly to avoid further injury. He said he was left heartbroken when he heard of Sadia’s death. “It takes a lot for me to cry and I just lost it when I heard. I mean, I have a 7-year-old, and to think of anything happening to her is incomprehensible.”
