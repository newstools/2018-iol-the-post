Durban - Tributes have been pouring in for well-known photographer Balakisten “Bala” Parasarman Govender who died in his Silverglen, Chatsworth, home on Sunday after a long illness. The 77-year-old father of three, who started Bala Govender and Sons Studios in 1952 at the age of 11, was laid to rest on Tuesday. 



His brother-in-law, Sydney Reddy, also a veteran photographer, said while Govender’s death was a devastating blow to the family, they have found solace in the rich legacy he has left behind. 



“In his early days, Govender ran a studio in Pine (now Monty Naicker) Street where he supplied pictures depicting the rise and fall of apartheid to newspapers like the POST, Graphic, Drum and The Leader,” he said. 



“His studio was also popular for doing school class and graduation photographs.”



Reddy said Govender had photographed Queen Elizabeth II during her visit to Durban for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference in 1999. 



His studio was appointed official conference photographers.



Describing Govender as down-to-earth, Reddy said his brother-in-law had taught him everything he now knew about the business and industry.



“Bala was very helpful and was a wealth of knowledge when it came to photography."



"I am now in the business for 55 years and it is all because of his training and guidance.”



Govender is survived by his wife, Dolly, 62; son Trevor, also a photographer; and daughter Ronica, a restaurant owner in Gauteng. 



His other son, Anand, also a photographer, died in 2015.
