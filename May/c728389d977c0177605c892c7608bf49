Charlane Govender, 26, succumbed to her injuries on Thursday, two days after her mother Dolly, 55, sister Shanelle, 23, cousin Hannah Padayachee, 20, and her 26-year-old fiancé, Linton Mahommed, were buried. They were returning to their homes in Pietermaritzburg from a fun day at the beach in Durban on May 12 when a bus allegedly veered off the road and collided with the Nissan Sentra they had been travelling in. Govender’s uncle and Hannah’s father, Pastor Krubin Padayachee, said his niece’s death was yet another blow for the family. “We were praying she recovers but her injuries were too bad." "For our family, getting over their deaths will not be easy." "We are now finding our peace in prayer and God.” Padayachee encouraged authorities to clamp down on reckless and negligent driving. “If harsher laws are passed then motorists will be more cautious on our roads.” Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of culpable homicide was being investigated and no arrests had been made.
