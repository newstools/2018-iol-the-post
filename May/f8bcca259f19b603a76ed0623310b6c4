Durban - Nathan Rampersad, accused of setting his 17-year-old girlfriend alight, is fit to stand trial despite claims he suffers from a mental disability. Rampersad, 32, a grass cutter, appeared in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court last week, a day after he underwent a mental health assessment by a district surgeon to determine if he should be admitted to Fort Napier Hospital for observation. He was found to be fit to stand trial. He has been charged with attempted murder and arson. In April, he allegedly had an argument with his girlfriend because she did not clean the one-bedroom room they rented in a house in Northdale.
