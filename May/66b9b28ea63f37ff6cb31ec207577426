Standing on the lawns of Green Park, I was among thousands of royal fans caught up in the wedding celebrations of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on April 29, 2011. Prince William, the second in line of succession to the British throne, after his father Prince Charles, was marrying Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey. While I did not crack an invite, I arrived early to watch the big screens being set up, and later, as the royals exchanged their “I do’s”. What an elated experience as the Union Jacks of all sizes were waved by young and old, many with tears in their eyes. When the barrier gates were finally removed near the palace and opened to the park spectators, there was a rush to the front of the palace gates to watch the newly wedded couple on the balcony - to catch a glimpse of that anticipated moment - the kiss that sealed the deal. I was lucky to be there a moment in history! As Prince Harry weds actress Meghan Markle at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle on Saturday, the gardens surrounding Buckingham Palace will still be packed, and pubs doing a roaring trade as joy and happiness fills the air. The UK is steeped in great history, culture and heritage. The British are very patriotic. I’ve witnessed the love and respect they have for the Royals. I personally, like many, have always been fond of the Royal Family and was one of those eager and fortunate people to celebrate in the Queen Mom’s 100th birthday, standing outside Buckingham Palace gates as she waved from that balcony, and then, alas, to line the Mall with thousands to bid her farewell at her funeral. Even though the newly-weds won’t be having their special moment on “that” balcony, rest assured, there will be crowds eagerly awaiting their arrival outside Windsor Castle.  * Annliza Chetty, who holds dual British and South African citizenship, worked as a registered nurse in London for 12 years.
