Durban - After four years of hard work and perseverance, a Pietermaritzburg woman achieved one of her greatest goals when she graduated with a PhD in law at UKZN. Asheelia Behari, 29, of Hayfields, attained a postgraduate academic degree after completing her dissertation on the reconciliation of work and care - a comparative analysis of South African labour laws aimed at providing working parents with time off to care for their children. It compared labour laws against international and regional labour laws and those of the UK. Her dissertation, she said, took two years to formulate and an additional two years to write. “I spent many days and nights sitting in front of my computer. However, it was all worth it when I graduated. "I felt proud of myself as I was a step closer to achieving more of my goals.” Behari, a law lecturer at UKZN, Pietermaritzburg campus, said one of the requirements of her job when she started five years ago was to work towards her PhD. “I am glad I had an encouraging husband (Aneeth Sadanand), dad (Radesh) and mom (Reeni), who, as a teacher, always spoke to me about the importance of an education.” Now that her studies are complete, she intents enjoying some of the luxuries she has missed, including reading her favourite fiction novels.
