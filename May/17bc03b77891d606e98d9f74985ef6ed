Durban - Shot through the temple and chest - allegedly by the man she had dated for 18 months - it was a “miracle” that Catherine Govender survived, her devastated family said. While the 43-year-old woman recovers in hospital, her former boyfriend, Alvin Naidoo, 49, appeared at the Verulam Magistrate’s Court on Monday on a charge of attempted murder. Govender was shot on the second floor of her Ironbridge Road flat after allegedly being dragged down the stairs. Her mother, Manormoney Naicker, told POST that her daughter had just ended the relationship with Naidoo the previous night. “There was a lot of tension between them. Catherine had told him she wanted to end the relationship. "He did not argue, he just said he was going,” Naicker said, adding that he returned the next morning. “It was around 6am. Catherine’s eldest son had just left for work when we heard a knock on the door. When she went to open the door she saw him standing there, saying he wanted to talk to her.” Her daughter, she added, refused to talk to him and then she heard screams, then gunshots. “When I went down the stairs I saw her lying in the passage with blood pouring from her face.” Naicker said her daughter was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds to the temple and upper chest. “She is recovering. It is a miracle, but we just want her to come home as her youngest daughter has been crying for her.” A third shot was also fired, according to a neighbour who said the bullet penetrated his door. Naidoo is expected to apply for bail next week. POST
