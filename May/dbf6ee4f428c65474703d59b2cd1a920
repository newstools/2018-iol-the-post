Durban - The concept and topic of live-in relationships has been taboo in India but the times are changing with a number of women coming out in its support, according to a survey. Inshorts, a news app, conducted a poll recently capturing the views of more than 100000 netizens - 80% being in the age group of 18-35 years, read a statement. According to the survey, more than 80% of millennials think that live-in relationships are still considered a taboo in Indian society, while more than 47% of Indians are of the opinion that marriage is better, when choosing between marriage and lifelong live-ins. More than 80% of Indians said they do support live-ins as a way of life. Of these, 26% of millennials said they would choose lifelong live-ins as an option over marriages. On the other hand, 86% of Indians are of the opinion that lust is not the sole reason behind live-ins and more than 45% say that it is compatibility testing before marriage. In the report, 45% of respondents also said that Indian society constantly judges unmarried couples staying together; any move by the judiciary to support this will not have any effect on their mindset. Azhar Iqubal, the CEO and co-founder of Inshorts said: “Live-in relationships, even after being legally recognised by the government, is a forbidden subject of discussion.” POST
