Durban - When he was 18, AV Vallymahomed started selling Bic ballpoint pens and hair combs at the corner of what was then Queen and Grey streets. “I needed to make an income. I was the youngest of six and my parents were elderly so we all did our share.” Earning R33 a month, he sometimes made ends meet. “I would contribute to our home but I would also keep money away for my special lunch. "I love Indian meals so I would make my way to Patels and for sixpence I would treat myself. "It feels good to say that even after 60 years I still enjoy the food and once a week I go over with R20 in my pocket for a filling meal.” At 17, after seeing the plight and hardships of people, Vallymahomed, who completed Standard 8 at Orient Islamic School, received his calling. “I saw what was happening and how people were suffering so I decided I wanted to bring about some change and I joined the Natal Memon Jamat Youth League. "My job was to assist in raising funds for widows and destitute families. After the success of my first project, I was elected chairman of the organisation and that pushed me even more to assist fellow human beings.” In the 1970s Vallymahomed shared the announcers’ platform with Ronnie Govender at the South African Soccer Federation and soon purchased his own league club, Cape Town United. “I owned the club for about a year or so then I sold it. I guess I moved away from sport to looking at social welfare needs. "I got more involved in the community and after proving my leadership qualities at the Natal Union Jamaat I was elected the president. "Through this new title I was able to assist people from all walks of life wherever I could.” Added Vallymahomed: “My dream has always been to help homeless people and children from disadvantaged homes. “In the Qur’an the message is a person cannot eat a grain of food if their fellow human being is starving and I believe in that saying.” POST
