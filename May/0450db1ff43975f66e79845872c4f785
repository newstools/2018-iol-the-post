Durban - A British court has convicted a mother of forcing her daughter to marry a relative almost twice her age in Pakistan, in a first successful prosecution of its type in England. A jury at Birmingham Crown Court on Tuesday convicted the mother of four of duping her then 17-year-old daughter into travelling to Pakistan on the pretext of a family holiday in 2016 and forcing her to marry there, the BBC reported. The mother was found guilty of two counts of forced marriage and was scheduled to be sentenced. The court heard the girl had been entered into a "marriage contract" with the man years before in Pakistan and became pregnant at 13. The victim had an abortion on returning to the UK, with her doctor reporting his concerns to social services. Prosecutors said the girl's mother told them that her daughter and the man were just "two teenagers who had sneakily had sex" after she was referred, the BBC said. The girl was tricked into travelling to Pakistan again in September 2016 and was forced by her mother to sign marriage papers. When the daughter protested against the marriage, her mother threatened to burn her passport and assaulted her. The mother was also convicted of perjury after she lied about the incident in the High Court. It is the first time a forced marriage case of this kind has been successfully prosecuted in an English court. Prosecutions for forced marriage, which became an offence in 2014, are rare. POST
