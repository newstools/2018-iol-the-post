Durban - KZN Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo has responded to the blood bank’s desperate calls for blood donation – and he is urging the public to also heed this desperate call to help save lives. At the moment blood stocks are at critical levels enough to last just 1,3 days. People in urgent need of regular blood supply may include mothers giving birth, cancer patients, people involved in road crashes, and patients who suffer complications during major surgery. But Mr Sifiso Khoza, KZN regional marketing director at the South African National Blood Service, says the organisation is concerned that blood donors have not been donating enough blood lately. “We currently only have blood that is enough to last 1,3 days. People just do not donate." "We are not quite sure why, and it has taken us by surprise." "We do not know what went wrong. The situation is critical." "We are appealing to residents of KwaZulu-Natal – active donors, potential donors and lapsed donors – to help to bolster the regional blood stock.” Although all blood types are needed, blood group-O is in demand as it is universal and can be transferable to all patients in need. Dhlomo, who is a blood-O donor, wass moved by the plight of the SANBS this weekend, and urged all South Africans who are eligible to step forward and help save lives. Speaking while donating blood at Umlazi Megacity, Dhlomo said: “I am always concerned when I hear that the province has low blood stocks. It always serves as a timely reminder for me to honour my appointment to donate blood." "I would wish that all of us who are already regular blood donors can remember and honour the days of our appointments." "We are not meeting the required levels, and that is extremely concerning." "So we are calling upon other South Africans who are not yet regular blood donors to come forward and assist us." South Africans who are in good health and between the ages of 16 and 65 qualify to donate blood. POST
