Durban - A Phoenix man who knocked and killed two cyclists on the M4 Ruth First Freeway in February 2016, has been sentenced to 10 years in jail. Dressed in a pinstripe suit and crisp white shirt, Omesh Ramnarain,34, did not react as Magistrate Anand Maharaj passed sentence in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Friday afternoon. The supervisor at plumbing company was found guilty of 2 counts of culpable homicide in April 2018. The court found that Ramnarain, who was driving a VW Golf GTi, had knocked cyclists Richard da Silva, 46, and Jarred Dwyer Dwyer, 36. He had been returning from a nightclub. Magistrate Maharaj said he hoped the sentence would serve as a deterrent. Ramnarain’s council, Advocate Murray Pitman, appealed the sentence which was granted. However Ramnarain will have report to prison as his appeal to have his bail extended, was denied. Minutes before sentencing, Ramnarain took the stand to express his remorse. He explained what happened was not of his character. “I am very sorry. I hope you find it in your head to forgive me someday,” said Ramnarain. However, Dwyer’s mother, Leigh said although the bible says one should forgive, she would never. “Mr Ramnarian I am perfectly willing to spend eternity in hell if I have to, but I will never forgive you for taking my son’s life,” she said. Da Silva’s partner for 26 years, Sonja Ferreira told the court her soul was broken and heart shattered. “We hope the judge makes the right decision, so he (Ramnarain) knows that he can’t do what he did, and only get a slap on the wrist,” she said.
