Durban - Fifth year medical student Karishma Ramdev is one step closer to achieving her childhood dream of becoming Miss SA. Ramdev was announced on Thursday, as one of the top 12 finalists for the Miss SA 2018, set to take place later this month. The 23 year old Chatsworth resident, who is currently a student at the University of Pretoria, received a prized package valued at R180 000. In an earlier interview with POST, Ramdev said entering the Miss SA has been a childhood dream. “I grew up with two dreams - to be a medical doctor and to be Miss SA. Being selected for the regionals means I am a step closer to achieving my dream," said Ramdev during the regional qualifiers in March. Ramdev enjoys horse riding, reading, going to gym and hiking. She loves mutton curry and dhal gosht and is addicted to the TV series Games of Thrones. On her career choice, Ramdev said medicine runs in the family blood. Her father is an optometrist; her mother is a radiographer and her youngest brother is studying veterinary science. The Miss SA will take place on May 27 at the Sun Arena at Time Square, Pretoria. The winner will receive more than R2 million in prizes. The other finalist from KwaZulu Natal is Noxolo Ndebele, 24, from KwaNongoma. Ndebele has a BComm Accounting degree and works as a financial controller. POST
