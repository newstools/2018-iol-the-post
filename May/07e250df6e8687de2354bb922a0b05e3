Durban - Freedom fighter, Swaminathan Gounden was celebrated at the 1860 Heritage Centre on Tuesday, after receiving the Order of Luthuli (Silver) award by President Cyril Ramaphosa, in Pretoria this weekend. The 90 year old struggle stalwart was recognised for his courage and conviction in the fight for equality during apartheid. Speaking at the centre Gounden said he was honoured to have received such a prestigious award. “Today I stand before you to dedicate this award to all those who lost their lives in the struggle. It is my dream that my work will serve as an inspiration to the younger generation of South Africa.” KZN portfolio committee chairperson, MM Ntuli, who later took that stage said she was grateful to share such a moment with Gounden. “We come together today to congratulate Gounden on a huge achievement that highlights the legacy of who we are and who we aim to be in the future. There’s no greater bravery than yours. We salute you Mr Gounden.” The event was attended by Gounden’s friends and family, as well as MEC for Human Settlements, Ravi Pillay, former High Court Judge Thumba Pillay and deputy mayor, Fawzia Peer who hailed Gounden for his selfless efforts. “You are a person that will never be forgotten and we can never follow in your footsteps. Swami it’s your day today and we celebrate your good deeds and all that you have done,” said Peer. Gounden worked at a shoe factory when he joined the ANC in 1950. He went on to actively participate in the Defiance Campaign of 1952 and the historic Kliptown Conference of 1955, where the Freedom Charter was formulated. Gounden was also arrested in 1964 under the Suppression of Communism Act and detained in solitary confinement for three months. He was acquitted due to lack of evidence. POST
