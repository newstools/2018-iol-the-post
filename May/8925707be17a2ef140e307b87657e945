Durban - Sinister forces are out to cause “turmoil” between the Christian and Muslim communities in Durban, according to a well-known Chatsworth pastor. Christian Revival Centre founder Paul Lutchman believes someone is out to damage his reputation and extort thousands of rand from him. 



He has asked police to investigate.



After distancing himself from Islamophobic DVDs that were said to be distributed in the community in his name, he told POST on Monday he was the victim of an extortion attempt. 



An envelope he described at “thick, nicely padded and expensive”, containing defamatory material against the Islamic faith, was sent to Lutchman’s church on Friday in an alleged effort to allegedly siphon R35000 from him.



The note demanded Lutchman transfer around R5000 via at least six cellpone numbers or material would continue to be distributed at mosques and churches.



Lutchman has opened a case of intimidation and extortion. 



“People were bringing the DVDs to us and questioning us if it was true. I was shocked to say the least."



"People are trying to cause turmoil between Christians and the Muslim community, which I have built a great relationship with over the years.”



Lutchman said he strongly believed it was the work of an individual or a group of people with “sinister motives” with the intention to cause friction between the two faiths. 



He confirmed that he had met the Muslim community to address the DVD and assured them of his church’s disdain for religious intolerance. 



“We are speaking to respected Muslim community leader Saleem Adam to remedy the issue.” 



Adam, who is the chairman of Silverglen Muslim Association and secretary of the Chatsworth Interfaith Group, said the message of the perpetrator was very clear, “to create tension”.



“Dr Lutchman is a wonderful man. We have a great friendship and he would never do something like this.”
