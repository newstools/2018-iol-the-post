Durban - Walking to her Clare Estate, Durban home after a long day in the CBD turned out to be a nightmare for the grandmother of 7-year-old Siziphiwe Libazi. The girl and a 5-year-old friend died when a wall collapsed on them this evening. “When I got near I saw people and the first thing that came to my mind was 'accident',” said Lungelisa Libazi. Her granddaughter and two others were playing outside when the wall collapsed on top of them. Siziphiwe and another died on scene while the third had to be rushed to hospital. The grandmother, her 23-year-old daughter and family members sat in their two bedroom outbuilding mourning for Siziphiwe. “She was always joking, laughing and such a bubbly child,” she said. The mother could not speak as she was in shock. When POST arrived at the scene of the home on Kennedy Road, community members had been washing the entrance of the home of the blood. According to Vincent Chetty, from the Clare Estate Action Committee, the girls had been playing and swinging on the gate when the wall collapsed. “Unfortunately two of the girls passed away while one was rushed to hospital for treatment." "The community is saddened by this and they are here to show their support.” The owner of the property, Hajra Naseem said they are also giving their support to all families and have been left heartbroken.
