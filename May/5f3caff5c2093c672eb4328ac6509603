Durban - The woman responsible for taking the lives of two Phoenix friends in May 2016, on the M4 near Blue Lagoon, was jailed for 10 years. Kearabilwe Refilwe Modise-Moloto, 40, looked shocked as sentencing was passed by Durban Regional Court Magistrate,Fariedha Mohamed, on Wednesday. Sumeer Maharaj, 26, and Pravin Mahabir, 25, were mowed down by Modise-Moloto on the M4 while changing their tyres. The court found that Modise-Moloto chose not to stop at the accident scene, and had filed a false accident report, in an attempt to repair her car. She was later arrested. Maharaj, a car spares salesman, died at the scene, while Mahabir, a part-time mechanic, succumbed to his injuries the next day. Modise-Moloto was found guilty of two counts of culpable homicide, failing to perform duties of a driver after an accident, and reckless and negligent driving. She was acquitted on the charge of defeating the ends of justice. Sumeer's mother Naseema Maharaj was overcome with emotion. "I am so happy. This day has finally come," she cried. Pravin's brother, Ashlen Mahabir said he will be going to church later to thank God for the positive sentencing. Modise-Moloto's application for leave to appeal her sentence was denied. POST
