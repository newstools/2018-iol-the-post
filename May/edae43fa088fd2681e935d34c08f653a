World - A 29-year-old Dalit woman who was allegedly set ablaze by her estranged husband in public view, in Kerala, India died early on Tuesday, police said. The husband, who is on the run, may have committed the crime as the woman sought divorce over compatibility issues, according to police. The incident took place on Sunday when Jithu emerged from the Kudumbashree meet -- a women's meeting. Viraj approached her and set her on fire by pouring petrol over her, according to a witness. "The Kudumbashree workers and the local village council member were present at the spot but no one came to her help. All of them stood as mute spectators as the woman was being burnt," said the witness. Her father tried to save her and took her to a hospital. He also suffered burn injuries. The couple, who had no children, separated sometime back as they used to have frequent fights. The divorce proceedings were about to start, said police who suspect that Viraj is now in Mumbai. POST
