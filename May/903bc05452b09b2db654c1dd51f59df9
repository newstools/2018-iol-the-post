Durban - At a staggering estimated cost of R100million, a new Durban Christian Centre Jesus Dome is expected to rise from the ashes of the iconic structure that burnt down two years ago. Construction was under way and the church was expected to be completed towards the end of next year, spokesman Ron Steel told POST.



The new building will seat 3000 congregants.



Steel said once the arches were up, work would then start on the main building. 



The church burnt down on June 7, 2016, after an electrical fault. 



Steel said it was believed that the illuminated cross at the top of the building had short-circuited because of several power outages that day, and the sparks had fallen into the auditorium.



For the past two years, services have been held in a building next to the church.



Steel said despite the challenges, Pastor John Torrens and his wife, Joy, were overwhelmed with the support from congregants for their fund-raising initiatives.



In one initiative, people can buy bricks at R200 each which will be used to build the church.



He said the aim was 30 000 bricks, and so far they had reached 10 000.



The new building would also house a Sunday school childrenâ€™s church as well as a fellowship centre and food hall.
