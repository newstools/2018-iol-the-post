Durban - To commemorate the 125th anniversary of the eviction of Mahatma Gandhi from a first-class train compartment at the Pietermaritzburg Railway Station, a schools essay-writing competition will be held - and the deadline for submissions is around the corner. The aim of the competition is to encourage youngsters to write about transforming moments in their own lives. Gandhi was evicted on June 4, 1893, for being a “person of colour”. He spent that cold night in the station’s waiting room and, instead of returning to India, vowed to stay in South Africa and fight racial prejudice. In later years, he said the incident had changed the course of his life: “My active non-violence began from that date.” From being an advocate in South Africa, Gandhi turned into a world leader, fighting against colonial discrimination and injustice through Satyagraha (truth force). The competition, organised by the High Commission of India in Pretoria and the Consulate of India in Durban, is open to pupils from Grades 10 to 12. The deadline is May 15. The topic is: “What was the turning-point moment in your life?” A maximum of three entries per school must be submitted to the consulate for the final selection. The essays, no more than 500 words, must be in English and the pupil’s own work. They would need to be certified by the school on an entry form provided at the consulate. Each entry must have a cover page with the name and contact details of the pupil. Entries can be e-mailed to indiainsouthafrica@gmail.com, posted to the consulate or dropped off there.
