The case dragged on for the first half of the day with no new information emerging in court since the morning. In court, the state cross-examined the accused about the day of his arrest in an attempt to prove that he had exaggerated allegations that he was assaulted by the arresting team. The bail application will continue on Thursday and has been set for Friday. An electrical fault at the Durban Magistrates Court at about 3.15pm saw the magistrate adjourn the matter for Thursday. Meanwhile, Lee's mother, Carmen Nan, spent the weekend behind bars after being arrested for malicious damage to property over a rental dispute with her landlord. She appeared in the same court on Monday and was released on a warning. A chirpy Carmen was present in court on Thursday for the bail hearing. Shouting from the gallery as she saw a TV crew set up inside the court, Carmen said: "Is his (the accused's) name going to be disclosed today? It should be." The accused is not being named as he is also accused of rape, amongst a raft of other charges.
