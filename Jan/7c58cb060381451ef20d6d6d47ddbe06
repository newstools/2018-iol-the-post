The Clifton College pupil, who has been provisionally accepted to study computer science and maths at the University of Cape Town, is thrilled to be pursuing his dreams.  “I wanted to study computer science and maths because I have a passion for both fields and love solving problems. To be able to combine two of my hobbies is exciting,” he said.  Rahul, who made the commendable list, will be the first in his family to further his studies away from home.  “It will be daunting for me as it is a new chapter in my life, but I am up to the challenge,” he beamed.  Rahul told POST he was determined to push himself to achieve better results after he was disappointed earlier in the year.  “At the beginning, my marks were not up to what I wanted and I pushed myself to do better. I made a mistake and realised I needed to take my mistakes as my biggest lessons. “I live by the quote, ‘Don’t waste a good mistake; learn from it’. It’s important to practise what you’re good at, but it’s also important to take each mistake and weakness and work on it consistently until it becomes a strength.” POST
