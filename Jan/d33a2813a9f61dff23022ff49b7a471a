Durban - Amir Karim achieved 7 distinctions and attributes his success to the support of his parents. 
The teen, of Eden College in Gauteng, has been provisionally accepted to study actuarial science at the University of Johannesburg. “I have always been a high achiever. Every year of my schooling career I worked hard, so when it came to matric it was no different.  "I kept to a strict study routine and, because of this, I was not stressed out.”  Amir advised the next batch of matric pupils to start working from day one.  “Plan. Make the sacrifices. Go for extra classes. It is all worth it in the end.” To add to his accolades, Amir is part of the Orange Carpet Rewards Programme at the university. “I applied to the programme during matric and, because of my good academic results, I was accepted.  The programme gives students discounts on their university fees for the year - depending on the number of distinctions they attain in matric.” Now Amir is enjoying his last few weeks at home before he starts university.
