Durban - Growing up in a house full of doctors has inspired Crawford College La Lucia matriculant Maseeha Bhorat to follow in her family’s footsteps, including those of dad Dr Ismail Bhorat, an acclaimed foetal specialist. 
After passing matric with flying colours and making the IEB commendable list, achieving within the top 5% of pupils in five subjects and scoring 80% or more for life orientation, Maseeha is hoping to study medicine this year. She achieved 8 distinctions in all her subjects - English, Afrikaans, maths, French, physical science, life science, life orientation and advanced programme maths. The 18-year-old, of La Lucia, has been provisionally accepted to study at Wits University, University of Pretoria and the University of Cape Town, but has her heart set on the Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine. “They did not have a pre-selection process at UKZN, so I am anxiously waiting to find out if I will be studying there,” she said. “I always knew I would go into the medical field. It is in my family’s genes. My father and two sisters are qualified doctors, while my other sister and brother are currently studying. They are my inspiration and motivation to always do my best.” Added Maseeha: “I am excited for my results and have learnt that you have to be organised as there is very little time. Also don’t procrastinate and live a balanced life. I will follow these steps in my new journey at university.” POST
