Durban - The Supreme Court on Monday said it will re-examine its verdict upholding Section 377 of the IPC that criminalises gay sex. 
A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra decided to re-examine the top court's earlier order upholding section 377 of the Indian Penal Code.  "Our earlier order needs to be reconsidered," said Justice Misra on Monday. The court order came on a petition by 10 individuals holding that IPC section 377 was "violative of fundamental rights under Article 14 (right to equality) and Article 21 (right to life)". The Supreme Court had earlier set aside a Delhi High Court verdict decriminalising the gay sex. While referring the matter to a larger bench the court observed "what is natural to one may not be natural to others".  POST
