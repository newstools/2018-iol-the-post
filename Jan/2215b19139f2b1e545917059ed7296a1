Durban - Hard work and perseverance has paid of for Raisethorpe Secondary School pupil, Sanam Maharaj, who scored 6 distinctions in the NSC 2017.  Sonam has been accepted to study towards a Bcom accounting degree at Wits University in Gauteng and UKZN (Pmb campus).  She intends sending her maths paper, in which she scored a B pass, back for a remark.  “It was a difficult year but I worked hard to succeed. I did not have a social life, but it was worth it in the end,” said the 17-year-old of Allandale.  Sonam spent the holidays with family and catching up on reading science fiction and horror novels.  Her father, Shanjay, is a commercial property broker, and her mother, Moushumi, is a English teacher.  She has two siblings, Sahay (Grade 10) and Saurav (Grade 3).  POST
