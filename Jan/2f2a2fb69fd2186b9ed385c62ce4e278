Durban - Following in her older brother’s footsteps, 17-year-old Kiara Pillay is set to pursue a career as an actuary. 
The Kloof High School matriculant, who obtained seven As and finished ninth in KZN’s Top 10, has received an entrance scholarship from UCT. “My favourite subjects were mathematics and accounting and after doing research, I saw that an actuary would combine both. “My brother, Kailen, is a third year actuarial science student at UCT and enjoys this field. His career advice has helped me realise that I too would enjoy it.” The Shallcross resident, who was awarded the dux and subject awards at her school, said she did not expect to perform as well as she had. The most challenging part of the year, she said, was when her biggest motivator, her grandfather, died in July. “He experienced many trials and tribulations but still worked hard to provide for his family. He was proof that hard work pays off and he, as well as my parents (Kayson and Vernie) became my inspiration.” Her advice to future matriculants, is to set goals and eat and sleep well. “My mom told me that the size of one’s dreams must always exceed one’s capacity to achieve.” POST
