Shweta , 17, of Chatsworth, a matriculant at Wingen Heights Secondary School, attributed her success to hard work. “Matric is a tough year, but constantly working with past papers, doing revision and attending extra classes really paid off,” she said. “The added support from family, friends and teachers also gave me comfort when I felt overwhelmed.” Shweta advised the matric class of 2018 to believe in 
themselves. “Put your head down and work. It’s a huge effort, but the end-results are well worth it. Try not to stress out too much and remain focused.”  Now that she has received her results, Shweta is taking time out to relax. “The wait was nerve-racking. I am now looking forward to spending time with friends and family before university starts.” Her mother, Usha Dev-narain, said: “Shewta has been a go-getter since Grade 1. We are proud of her achievement.” POST
