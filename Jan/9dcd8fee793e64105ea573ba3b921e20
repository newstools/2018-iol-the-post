Durban - Cartoon character Minnie Mouse has got her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Singer Katy Perry and supermodel Heidi Klum wore polka dots to celebrate the milestone. The Disney character was honoured with the 2,627th star in front of El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on Monday, reports aceshowbiz.com. Minnie's partner Mickey Mouse as well as Disney Chairman and CEO, Bob Iger, also attended the ceremony. Perry wore a custom dress and hat by Christian Siriano for the special occasion. She playfully said as she began her presenter's speech, "Who wore it best, who wore it best?" Minnie greeted the "Dark Horse" hitmaker with a smile and exchanged a welcome kiss with the singer on the podium. Klum, meanwhile, opted for a black polka dot dress, which she accessorised with a mouse ear headband. The honour came 40 years after Mickey Mouse received his star in 1978 and became the first cartoon character to get a star. This year marks the 90th anniversary of the "official First Lady of Walt Disney Company" in entertainment since first being created in 1928. "I'm so grateful and I want to thank all my friends from around the world. And Mickey, I'm so happy you're here to share this wonderful day with me," Minnie Mouse said in her speech. Minnie added: "This really is the best day ever!" Perry said of the cartoon character: "It's always so comforting to see her face. Seeing Minnie is like returning home. It is a special skill to bring joy to so many and she does it with an effortless bat of a lash." POST
