Making the IEB “outstanding” list was all in a day’s work for Saneshan, a straight A pupil who said he drew inspiration from Albert Einstein.  “He managed to achieved greatness and respect despite constantly being told he would fail when he was young.” Saneshan hopes to contribute to the country’s economy when he becomes an actuarial scientist. The Crawford College North Coast matriculant said: “I dream of becoming the CEO of a major company and contributing towards improving the lives of others.” He has been provisionally accepted at the University of Pretoria. Saneshan has more than 20 academic achievements, including having his senior full colours for academics from Grades 10 to 12.  POST
