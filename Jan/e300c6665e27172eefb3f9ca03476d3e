Durban - Birthday celebrations at a Chatsworth home came to a standstill after one of the guests was hijacked and taken on a terror ride to uMlazi. The 59-year-old man from Queensburgh managed to escape by jumping from the moving car. He had just arrived at his relative’s home in Woodhurst last Monday night and, while helping his wife out of their Mercedes-Benz, they were accosted by three armed men. According to a relative who requested anonymity, the man pleaded with the hijackers to let his wife, who was ill, go free. “But the hijackers pushed him into the back of the car and drove to uMlazi. We were frantic and family members drove to KwaMashu, Lamontville and uMlazi searching for the vehicle.” The relative explained that the men stopped at uMlazi B Section and ransacked the boot. “They asked him for all his personal information. During this time we tried to call him and the men became angry and hit him with the butt of the gun. They then told each other that he was with them for too long and they needed to get rid of him.” The relative said the man became concerned about his safety and as the hijackers approached a bend he opened the car door and jumped out. “He sought help from a taxi driver who took him to a satellite police station and the family was called in to fetch him. We are so happy he is well and was not seriously injured.” Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the incident was being investigated and no arrests had been made. POST
