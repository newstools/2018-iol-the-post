Durban - Irate parents formed a human barricade at the entrance to a high school in Isipingo, south of Durban, on Monday morning, refusing to allow the principal and his staff onto the premises for registrations until they received answers about their children’s future. POST reported last month that 37 Grade 8 and 9 pupils at Strelitizia Secondary School would have to repeat the year as they had failed the second language subject, Afrikaans. The parents had approached their local councillor, Sunil Brijmohan, to assist them. Brijmohan told POST the parents were now demanding answers and until they got them the gates to the school would remain shut today as schools across KwaZulu-Natal reopened. “The future of these young children now lies in the hands of the (KZN) Department of Education. It is appalling and heart-wrenching to see these parents who have invested their energy, support and hard-earned money by paying school fees, which now stands at R3850 for the new year, to be told that their children will have to repeat a year of school because they had failed an ‘apartheid’ subject,” he said.
