Durban - Chatsworth youth Sivashen Reddy has worked hard to achieve academic success and was one of two students who recently received the UKZN Distinguished Student Award. 
The 21-year-old, of Umhlatuzana, who holds an honours degree in computer science and graduated summa cum laude at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said the award was bestowed upon the most talented, caring and exceptional graduates and young leaders from the final year undergraduate or honours level. “The recipients embodied the ideals and attributes the university sought to create in every graduate,” said Reddy proudly. However, his achievements does not end there. The former Kharwastan Secondary School pupil, who matriculated with eight distinctions, was also selected as one of the university’s Top 40 most inspiring students for 2017 and was among the GradStar Top 10 students in South Africa this year. The GradStar programme, sponsored by First National Bank, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Comair and Fasken Martineau, recognises the Top 100 students across the country based on their leadership qualities and readiness for the workplace and from there the Top 10 finest students are selected. “It was a great honour to be recognised for my hard work. This journey was tough and involved sleepless nights, tears and most importantly determination but was all worth it.” Reddy, who is the vice president of the Golden Key International Honours Society at UKZN, helps in hosting a range of community projects, including book drives and community upliftment and development programmes. In his spare time, he plays squash and reads. “I also love to write and am in the process of writing my first non-fiction book.” He intends completing his masters degree in computer science and hopes to open his own charity. The second recipient of the UKZN Distinguished Student Award was Sizwe Sidaza. POST
