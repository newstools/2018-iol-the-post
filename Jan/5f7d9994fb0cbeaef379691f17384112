Durban - Perseverance, dedication and a great support system is what worked for Merebank Secondary School matriculant Shivaan Premdutt, who scored 7As. 
The 18-year-old said one of his challenges was the lack of sleep. “Grade 12 requires late nights and early mornings to complete many revision papers, but it is all worth it in the end.” He hopes to study medicine and is leaning towards the University of Limpopo. “It has always been my dream to become a medical doctor to assist people and help the needy. I hope to specialise in cardiology or gynaecology. I also hope to open my own practice.” He added that he owed his successes to his dad, Sanjay, a creditors manager, and his mom, Vijay. “They have always been my number one support structure and have motivated me to excel.” They travelled to Prasanthi in India in December, which allowed him to relax. “The trip was a great way to take my mind off the anticipation of awaiting my results. However, the stress got me a couple of hours before the results were released.” Shivaan’s advice to the class of 2018: “Never let others dictate to you or let the pressures of others influence you. Time management is key and one should prioritise to complete all tasks.” POST
