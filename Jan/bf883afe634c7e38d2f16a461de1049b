Durban - When Kaylen Lee Naicker was born, doctors were uncertain if the Phoenix resident would walk. “I used to walk on my toes as my heels were always swollen like tennis balls. My late great-grandmother, Janikeyamal Singh, had taken a vow and fasted for me, hoping that Lord Muruga would heal me. “She told my mother that despite me only being 2 at the time, I should carry kavady. Although I could not walk, as I was only a toddler, my mom carried me,” said Naicker, who was born with lymphoedema. It is a condition where his lymphatic system does not function in both legs and as a result there is no drainage. His mother, Anusha, who is a real estate agent, said: “I remember being in tears that day. I was concerned I would be unable to carry him and the heavy kavady but a miracle happened. It was as if God had heard my cries. "Once the procession started, a devotee, who was in a trance, took Kaylen from me and carried him to the temple. But the miraculous part was when we got home, he was able to put both his feet flat on the ground.” The single mother, said her now 17-year-old son, pictured, walks “flat footed” and has even graduated in Indian classical dance. “We held Lord Muruga in our heart that day and every day since then. With prayer all things are possible.” Her son, she said, continued to carry kavady at the Shri Mariamman Temple in Mount Edgecombe. Kaylen is currently balancing matric and completing his teacher’s diploma at the Kumari Shiksha Dance Institute. “While growing up I wanted to learn more about my culture. I started bharathanatyam classes at the age of 5 and recently graduated. "I am also starting to learn more about meditating with crystals. If you have a passion for what you do in life, you must follow through with it. I am eternally grateful for my second chance.” POST
