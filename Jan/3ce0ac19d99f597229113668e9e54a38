Durban - When Joshua Chetty took the stage to collect his prize at the national matric results function last Thursday, the audience erupted in applause. 
The top achiever in the NSC special needs learner category, Joshua, 18, has never allowed his disability to overshadow his hunger for success. The New Hope School, Gauteng matriculant, formerly from Durban, attained three distinctions. Weighing just 820g when he was born prematurely, he developed diplegic cerebral palsy, which affects his muscles and joints.  Although he can walk, he sometimes uses a wheelchair or walker. “Throughout my schooling, I tried to push my disability aside and focus on excelling academically,” he told POST.  “One of my hardest years was Grade 8, attending mainstream school. It was difficult to get around and this resulted in me sliding academically.” The following year, Joshua was transferred to the special needs school and his results improved.  He attributed his success to hard work, perseverance and family support. “Not once did my family tell me I could not do anything. “They always supported me and pushed me to achieve more than I thought I could.” He advised other pupils with disabilities to set personal goals. “Don’t be chained by your disability and don’t compete with the able bodied."
