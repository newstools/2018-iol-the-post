Durban - Budding medical doctor Lamisah Seedat made the IEB outstanding achievement list with 8 distinctions. 
The 18-year-old, of Oaklands, Johannesburg, has been provisionally accepted to study medicine and actuarial science at Wits. Inspired by the social work she does in impoverished communities through her school and by her sister, Samhaa Seedat, a third year medical student, Lamisah, of St Andrew’s School for Girls, is opting for a career in medicine. She is the head of community services at her school and through her community work, has been exposed to people who battle to obtain proper health care. “I want to make a difference and help people in need. This is one of the reasons I chose medicine. Between government and private services within the health sector, there is a huge gap. I feel we need to close that gap by implementing guidelines that will ensure South Africans receive the best possible health care.” As part of her work, Lamisah is also involved in the Joint Aid Management (JAM) programme, which provides meals for children in primary schools in poor communities.
