Durban - Kyler- Jade Govender achieved seven distinctions and intends to study actuarial science at UCT. 
The 17-year-old, of Greenbury Secondary School, said she was relieved the wait for results was over and she could prepare for the next chapter in her life. “My key to success was being organised. From the first day of matric, I started studying. When I felt overwhelmed or pressured, I prayed. Now I am just happy all my hard work has paid off and I can focus on going to university.”  She advised the matrics of 2018 to start studying from the beginning of the year. “Don’t wait for the exams to start preparing. Start focusing from day one and you will reap the benefits.” POST
