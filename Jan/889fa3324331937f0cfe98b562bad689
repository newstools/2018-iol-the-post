Letter - It has been almost 23 years into democracy and we are still faced with radical oppression. 
This is something I ask myself: Has apartheid ended or not? What is really going on that we as the citizens of South Africa don't know about? We have been hearing empty promises for too long from the opposition while the most corrupt leadership dissolves the nation.  There are scams and underground deals that's costing us millions as taxpayers. Recently, I was faced with a horrible experience of being racially mocked for being an Indian.  The security at the mall would not allow me in to use the ATM simply because I am an “Indian”.  Is this the free South Africa we live in today? I sat in the car for about 20 minutes until surprisingly I noticed the doors of the mall open to allow two young women who were of a different race.  Immediately I approached the security guards and they ignored me. I tapped on the glass window to get their attention, but they ignored my presence.  After some time they did come out and open the doors when they heard that I was going to report their behaviour. Sadly, after so many years of oppression racism still exists. We do not need equality as a nation to grow, we need equity.
