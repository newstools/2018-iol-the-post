Mohammed, of Reservoir Hills, hopes to follow in his parents’ footsteps. They are doctors.  He has applied to UCT, UKZN and Stellenbosch University and is hoping to get word this week on whether he has been accepted.  “Naturally, I hope to get into UKZN because this is home, but I would be happy either way.  “I think my only fear is the incessant protests that take place at universities.” Mohammed, the eldest of two, who loves playing cricket, soccer and tennis, said he made a concerted effort not to stress during his final year. “I never put in the long hours, I just made sure I understood everything I went over.  “I believe it’s not the quantity, but the quality of studying that’s ultimately important.  “I also took short breaks in between and hung out with friends to take my mind off everything.” POST
