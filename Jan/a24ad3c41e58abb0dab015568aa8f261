Letter - The article, “Transgender marries man of dreams” (POST, December 20-24) refers. 
Congratulations to the couple. May they have a happy married life. Read: Transgender marries man of dreams 
However, they should give their love and marriage greater publicity.  I say this because recently, SAfm had a discussion on the prejudice and violence against LGBT people. According to the researcher, more LGBT people were killed in the “Indian” community, than in other groups. Why is this so? Now Indians are not a monolithic group. They have very different cultures and belief systems.  None of the Indian religions (indigenous to India) teach prejudice, discrimination and violence against LGBT or anybody else, unlike certain other religions.  Yet the researcher lumped all Indians together and made a blanket pronouncement. On the other hand, the acceptance of difference and diversity in the whole of creation is integral to the Dharmic religions.  Yet like stuck records, some Hindus repeat the lie “all religions are the same” or even more ludicrous, “all religions teach the same thing”.  They don’t. This happens because Hindus just fail to read other scriptures.  If they did, they would never ever utter such falsehoods. And they would not accept being lumped together as a homogeneous group of “Indians” when there is no such homogeneity. POST
