Durban - An eight-month-old baby, sexually assaulted by her cousin, has undergone a three-hour-long surgery to repair the tears in her private parts at the city's Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital, said doctors on Tuesday. According to a doctor, the surgery was performed on Tuesday morning and the patient is currently in ICU and out of danger. "The surgery was performed this morning to repair damages of her private parts. It went on for three hours. She currently is out of danger and in the ICU," a senior paediatrics surgeon told IANS. The eight-month-old baby girl was sexually assaulted by her cousin in the national capital. Police said the incident occurred on Sunday when the baby's parents had gone to their work places and left her with other family members in west Delhi's Shakurpur Basti. "The victim's family stays on the first floor of their house and the other family members on the ground floor in Shakurpur Basti. "Accused Suraj, 28, who is a cousin of the child, took her to the other part of the building on the pretext of playing with her and sexually assaulted her," a senior police officer said. "When her mother, who works as a maid in the area, returned home, she found her daughter unconscious lying in a pool of blood. "She informed her husband, who is a manual labourer. They took her to a hospital and informed the police," he said. "During investigation, Suraj turned out to be the prime suspect. After he was grilled, he fled the home. This confirmed their suspicion of his involvement in the crime. He was later traced and arrested," he added. The baby suffered severe injuries to her vital organs. "Suraj has confessed to his crime. The family used to leave the baby at home with cousins and other family members while going for work. A case has been registered against Suraj under the provisions of POSCO," the officer added. POST
