Durban - Sachin Naidoo, 18, of Ballito, has yet to decide between actuarial science and mechatronic engineering.  Provisionally accepted at Wits and UCT, he said he was torn between the two. 
Sachin achieved 9 distinctions in his finals, making the IEB outstanding achievement list. He is leaning more towards actuarial science and is hoping to enter the business sector and one day become the chief executive of his own multi-billion rand company. But not before gaining some on-the-ground experience. “I’ve been looking at the career for quite some time and feel that it suits my own skills and passion,” he said. “I, however, want to gain first hand experience from others and then one day, start my own business venture.” Sachin said he was his biggest motivator during his matric year. “You have to be able to push yourself. No one can help you if you don’t help yourself.” He said listening to music and playing sports was his source of solitude amidst the stress of exams. “On weekends I used to kick a ball around with friends just to help me take my mind off exams.” Sachin, of Crawford College North Coast, said he was excited for the year ahead. “I’m glad that matric is over and I cannot be more eager to get the next chapter of my life started.” POST
