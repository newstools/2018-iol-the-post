Durban - A 30 - year - old KwaDukuza man was charged with statutory rape after allegedly abducting a 15-year-old girl from her home almost two weeks ago. The girl, said to be from a prominent family, was found unharmed by the SAPS Tactical Team and KwaDukuza detectives with the married father-of-two in Port Shepstone three days later. She was returned to family. While thankful to the community and police, they remained silent on the details of the alleged kidnapping. Her father said: “Our country’s statistics are disgraceful when it comes to cases such as these. The relevant departments need to mobilise people at ground level to catch the perpetrators. "While my daughter is fine physically, we are looking for an NPO to help deal with the trauma she has been through. “This is as much as I can say at this time. The matter is of a sensitive nature and we are therefore obliged not to share any further information on the case.” According to a source, the two were in a relationship. Pictures of the two together surfaced on social media and instant messaging groups but police have not confirmed this. The accused appeared in the KwaDukuza Magistrate’s Court yesterday and was released on bail. The case has been adjourned to next month. POST
