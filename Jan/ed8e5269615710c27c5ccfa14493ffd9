“Customers come in to get their necessities for kavady and their stories of devotion inspires me,” said the 34-year-old. “When my dad Kay opened the shop 20 years ago, he stocked some kavady items but over the years people began looking for brass chumbus, marigolds and murthies (statues) for their chariots and we slowly introduced these items." He added they sold hand-carved kavadies from India for those who wished to own them. He said he planned for the festival two months ago. “Some stock is available well in advance, while others, due to supply or a delay in shipping, goes right down to the wire. So it is important to be well prepared.” His mom, Reena, still assists in the business. POST
