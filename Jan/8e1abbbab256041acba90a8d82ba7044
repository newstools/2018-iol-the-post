Durban - A 12- year -old boy who was struck on the head by a falling tree branch while walking home from church has awakened from a coma but remains in ICU at Life Entabeni Hospital.  Aaryan Joshua’s 61-year-old grandmother, Nancy Soobramoney, who was also injured, sustained a broken femur.  She recently underwent an operation at King Edward VIII Hospital and is recovering at the family’s Umbilo home.  Aaryan, who has just completed Grade 6 at Carrington Heights Primary School, suffered a cracked skull.  There was also bleeding in his brain, and it was swollen so badly that surgeons had to remove a portion of his skull to ease the swelling. “I prayed to God for a Christmas miracle, and he did not fail me. On Christmas Day my baby awoke from his coma. It was the best gift for us,” said his mother Jayshree.  Since the ordeal on December 10, Jayshree has been at her son’s bedside. “Aaryan’s condition is stable. When he woke up he could not recognise me at first. It took him about two days to basically settle. There is still swelling in his brain and doctors will re-attach his skull once the swelling goes down.” Jayshree said her son was able to speak.  “It’s very slow, but he is trying. We are just taking things one day at a time.  “My mom has been discharged from hospital, but is unable to walk.” She said she was grateful to the hospital and doctors for their promptness and efficiency.
