Durban - Hoping to conquer a work field dominated by men, Durban Girls’ College matriculant Ammaarah Seedat will study mechanical engineering. 
She achieved 6 distinctions in her 7 subjects - English, isiZulu, maths, life science, physical science, history and life orientation. The 18-year-old of North Beach made the IEB commendable list and has been provisionally accepted to study at Wits and the University of Cape Town. She chose to study at the former. “I have always excelled in science and maths. It is also great that my elder brother, Ismail, is studying the same course at Wits, so I will have a great support system when I move to Johannesburg.” She continued: “I also chose this career path as there aren’t many women in the industry, so I hope to break the stereotype and mindsets surrounding certain career choices.” POST
