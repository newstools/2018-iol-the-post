Durban - Keyana Padayachee, 18, of Sheffield Beach in Ballito, said the amount of work she had to cram in such a short space of time was one of the most stressful parts of her matric year. 
“There was just so much to do, so much to learn. But I thank God for my parents, who always encouraged me to not give up and to do my best,” she said. “Lots of prayer also helped calm me. I live by the motto, ‘I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me’.” Keyana, of Crawford College North Coast, passed with a commendable achievement, attaining a staggering 9 distinctions - in accounting, Afrikaans, English, geography, information technology, life orientation, maths, advanced programme maths and physics. Now that the IEB results are out, Keyana said she would unwind before starting university. Thriving on numbers, she will study actuarial science at Wits University. “Maths is one of my strong points and I thought this would be a great challenge for me. Once I graduate, I hope to work for a large firm as an actuarial scientist.” POST
