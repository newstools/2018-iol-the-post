According to hospital spokesman Thami Chizama the woman was unable to speak when she arrived at the hospital.

He said Naicker claims that she lived around the Damorosa Secondary School in Unit 9,Chatsworth. "All she can remember is that she has a brother named Colin and two daughters but she cannot remember their names. “Naicker has been at the hospital since last year and we desperately need to find her family."
