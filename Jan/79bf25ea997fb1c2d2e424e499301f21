Durban - It has been four months of heartache for the parents of two young siblings who lost their lives in a mysterious accident when the vehicle in which they were travelling to work overturned. Nikhiel and Threshen Karamchand died on September 23 and their devastated father, Suren, 51, suffered a heart attack when he was told of their deaths. The family are desperate for closure but they need to know what caused the accident, which also claimed the lives of the siblings’ friends, Anil Muganlall and Nathaniel Peter. The accident happened on Phoenix Highway near Eastbury. “We are all devastated. Life has become a standstill for us and it’s time we got some closure,” Suren Karamchand said. “We have heard rumours about an Avanza (a Toyota vehicle) being involved but it is just speculation until we get concrete evidence. Looking at the vehicle, I personally believe the Toyota Corolla they were travelling in had been pushed off the road,” he said. The four friends, aged between 17 and 23, were on their way to Rocca Bar, a nightclub where Threshen, a financial adviser at Old Mutual, was a resident DJ. Karamchand, who is recovering from quadruple bypass heart surgery, said since their sons’ passing, he and his wife, Lisa, 41, have been struggling daily. “We lost our only sons and I have nothing to lose anymore. It was Nikhiel’s birthday on Sunday and he would have turned 18. He was looking forward to his 18th and his crown birthday (21),” he said. “No amount of time can heal the pain we are going through and even if God himself comes down to say it will be alright, I will not believe him because he took both my sons away.” Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed their investigation was still ongoing. “Charges of culpable homicide were opened at the Phoenix Police Station,” she said.
