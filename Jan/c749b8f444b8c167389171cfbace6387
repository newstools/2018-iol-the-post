Durban - Hours of toiling in the sun and rain to grow thousands of marigolds was worth the back-breaking work, said Shane Ramsewak, whose field of yellow and orange flowers are sold in Durban and Johannesburg. The former eThekwini Municipality employee, who worked at the roads department, has been kept on his toes to ensure a good, healthy crop of the plants, which will be used for the Hindu festival of Thai Poosam Kavady that starts next week. Ramsewak’s three hectares of marigold is located near RK Khan Hospital in Chatsworth. “My dad Deepraj was unemployed and lived in Welbadacht. Using whatever he had, he would grow these flowers and supply them. When I was younger, I helped him and later took up the trade.” He left his job with the municipality a decade ago, saying it was the best decision he had made. “I love what I do and am expanding the business by growing marigolds on other plots in Chatsworth,” he said. “I feel really happy when people take selfies or photographs among the flowers and remark how beautiful it is.” He said suppliers would soon come knocking at his door to collect the flowers for sale at shops for Kavady. “More than half of the field will go to suppliers in Johannesburg and I will sell the rest in boxes to devotees. I always try to keep the price reasonable.” Ramsewak added that it took about four months for the flowers to grow in time for the festival, one of the busiest in the year. POST
