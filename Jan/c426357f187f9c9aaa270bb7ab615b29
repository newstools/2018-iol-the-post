Durban - For Shenise Singh, of Glenhills, coming in the province’s Top 10 was a shock. 
The 17-year-old Greenbury Secondary School matriculant, who obtained seven distinctions and came first in the Pinetown district and fifth in the province, said: “I wasn’t aiming for the Top 10. I did, however, work extremely hard because I wanted a place in medical school. “From the time I was little, I used to admire doctors and their ability to make me feel better and as I got older, I wanted to give back to the country.” Although she did not receive a bursary, the teen is determined to study medicine at the University of the Witwatersrand. “I have mixed emotions about this new journey. “On the one hand I am excited to relocate but on the other hand, I am anxious to leave my family and friends. “I have been learning to fend for myself, in terms of cooking, cleaning and washing clothes, so hopefully I will manage.” She said that other than her family, the school’s staff were very dedicated. “Our teachers would have an extra hour of class every day after school, so we could complete the syllabus and they would avail themselves at lunch breaks and over the school holidays.” POST
