Durban - Scottburgh resident Sanam Brijraj will know shortly if she has been accepted to study civil engineering and, if she gets the nod, she will join her two older sisters in the same field. 
Her eldest sister, Sahara, 28, has a degree in geology and is currently a fourth-year student at UKZN, while Soniya, 19, is a third-year student at the same institution. “I have been provisionally accepted at UKZN and UCT, but would prefer going to Cape Town to gain independence,” said Brijraj, 17, who got 7 As at Scottburgh High School. She has applied for place at the campus residence. Sanam said that after attaining 5 As and 2 Bs at trials, she knew she had to buckle down.  “I realised my goals were achievable and I put my head down and worked.” “The hope with this is to get my honours degree and become a qualified surveyor,” she said. Her mom, Reshna, is a primary school principal, and her dad, Reshwant, an advocate.  Her brother, Sahil, 30, lectures physics at UKZN. POST
