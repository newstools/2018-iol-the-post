Durban - In an urgent bid to stop the scourge of stones and bricks being thrown at vehicles from overhead bridges, Deputy Mayor Fawzia Peer has proposed that safety barriers and closed-circuit cameras be installed over bridges in hotspot areas. Councillor Peer, who also chairs eThekwini Municipality’s Safety and Emergency Committee, said this proposal will be one of the urgent items on the committee’s agenda this year. “We are investigating the possibility of installing safety barriers in the form of steel cages to prevent objects being thrown from overhead bridges. This cannot be done overnight as normal Council processes will have to take place and this will also depend on funding,” said Councillor Peer. The investigation will include identifying the bridges where the safety barriers and cameras will be installed. “We are very concerned about the increase in these incidents, and wish to reassure the public that the Municipality is acting swiftly to find a lasting solution to this issue.  "We will be speaking to communities in areas where these incidents have occurred to work with the City, and encourage them to report those that are responsible for these criminal acts,” added Councillor Peer. A task team will be formed by the Municipality to oversee the implementation of all proposed interventions. This includes ensuring increased police visibility after conducting a risk assessment to identify hotspots. POST
