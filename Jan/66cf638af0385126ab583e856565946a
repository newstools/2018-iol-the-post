Durban - A 44-year-old man is expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court this week after being found with R485 000 worth of drugs.  KZN Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, said members of the Provincial Drug Unit acted on an intelligence driven information about the suspect transporting drugs in the Durban CBD.  "The members spotted the silver Toyota Corolla in the vicinity of Cathedral Lane, Durban, and intercepted the vehicle.  "The driver was searched and was found in possession of a cigarette box. Inside the box there were two clear packets which contained 15 grams of cocaine." Mbhele said further investigation led the team to suspect’s house in Botanic Road where more drugs were recovered. "Inside the house the members found a black bag with lots of packets with mandrax and ecstasy tablets. An amount of R30 000 was also found inside the bag and is suspected to be the proceeds of drugs."  She said the total estimated value of the recovered drugs is R485 000.  The suspect has been charged with dealing in drugs.  The KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, praised the team for the swift arrest and the recovery of drugs.  “We will make sure that all those who are dealing in drugs are put in the right place behind bars. “We will continue with our operations as part of the Safer Festive Season operations,” he said.
