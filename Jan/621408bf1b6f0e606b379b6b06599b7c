Kiara, 17, of Meyersdal, south of Johannesburg, obtained seven distinctions and made the outstanding commendable list in her matric exams.  It’s another feather in her cap after clinching the Google Science Fair title - and a $50000 (R620000) educational scholarship - last year. But she is still undecided on what to study and trying to figure out which college will help her in the biomedical field.  The St Martin’s School pupil, who entered the competition in Grade 11,  created a low-cost biodegradable super-absorbent polymer made of orange peel and avocado skin.  “When I entered, I wanted to put a spotlight on one of the main issues we South Africans face. I wanted to find a solution to the drought by using material that can retain water,” she said. “Along with my prize, I got the opportunity to go to New York in April to check out the universities.  “I also got to meet fellow South African Trevor Noah.” The school’s head girl advised matric pupils to prepare well in advance for their final year of study.
