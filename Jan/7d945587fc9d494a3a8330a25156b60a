This is the fourth time the school attained 100%.  It is also one of 109 schools in KwaZulu-Natal to have produced top results.  Said principal Vic Pillay: “The relationship between parents and staff is special and important. Parents can come to see staff any time and vice versa. By working together, all our pupils passed, even those who were in danger during the trials.  “We paid special attention to them and worked together to ensure no pupil was left behind.” The school recorded 80% bachelor passes, 15% diploma passes and 5% higher passes.  The top four achievers were Shivar Gopaulsingh (9 distinctions), Vilashni V Mottian (8), Kerishnie K Naidoo (7) and Kamden K Pillay (5).  Pillay said one of the pupils went through a challenging time. “His mother died and we all pulled through to support him. He got a bachelor's pass and is one of our success stories. His perseverance to do well for his mom touched all.”  POST
