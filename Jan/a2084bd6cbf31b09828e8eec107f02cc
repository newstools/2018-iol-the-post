Durban - Using her culinary skills, Neetha Reddy turned the misfortune of being retrenched from her job into a profitable business, making and selling savouries. Reddy, 45, of Grove End, Phoenix, worked as a marker at a clothing factory when she was retrenched in March 2015. “My whole world came crashing down on me when I learnt the company I worked at for 10 years was due to close and I would be out of a job. This was my bread and butter and I was completely shattered.” At the time, Reddy and her husband Pragasen, 42, a merchandiser, worked as a team, sharing household expenses. The mother of two said she also supported her elderly parents, who she lived with. “Pregasen became the sole supporter of our home and things started to get difficult financially. We were basically living hand to mouth.” In 2016, Reddy toyed with the idea of opening a business. “While growing up, my mom taught me to cook, and while she worked I would get supper ready for my siblings and myself. They simply loved my breyanis.” She said cooking had become a hobby and a relative, Leena Arjun, encouraged her to take the plunge and open a home-based business. In February 2016, Reddy launched Neetha’s Savouries and Platters. “My family and friends initially supported my business and I soon advertised and started a Facebook page. Since then, business has been going well. Financially, things have greatly improved. With the profit, I buy groceries for our home and pay my children’s school fees.” The best part of her job, said Reddy, was being her own boss. She also advised matriculants who could not afford tertiary studies to consider starting their own businesses. “But ensure your parents or someone you trust can advise you on the pros and cons and that you are aware of the financial implications and challenges. Never be afraid to start from the bottom.” POST
